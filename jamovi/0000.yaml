      of all individual  observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate
      survival estimates that account  for varying follow-up durations. Use this
      when you want to analyze overall survival  characteristics of your entire
      study population - for example, to determine median  survival time or
      1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.

      Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards
      regression. In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is

      observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates
      person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the
      instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying
      analyses or examining multiple predictors, the model accounts for how
      these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at risk in
      each subgroup.

    description: >-
      Performs comprehensive survival analysis with time-dependent variables
      using the Simon-Makuch method. This specialized analysis addresses the
      critical challenge of immortal time bias when studying treatments,
      biomarkers, or exposures that change during patient follow-up.

      **Clinical Applications:** - Treatment effectiveness when therapy timing
      varies (e.g., adjuvant therapy, targeted agents) - Biomarker evolution
      studies (e.g., mutation status, protein expression changes) - Disease
      progression impact on outcomes (e.g., metastasis development, grade
      progression) - Healthcare intervention timing effects (e.g., surgery,
      radiation, supportive care)

      **Key Statistical Methods:** - Simon-Makuch plots: Modified Kaplan-Meier
      curves for time-dependent exposures - Landmark analysis: Conditional
      survival from fixed time points - Time-dependent Cox regression: Hazard
      ratios accounting for exposure timing - Immortal time bias assessment:
      Comparison of naive vs. proper methods - Mantel-Byar testing: Specialized
      tests for time-dependent comparisons

      **Why Use Simon-Makuch Analysis:** Standard survival analysis assumes
      fixed baseline characteristics, leading to immortal time bias when
      exposures change during follow-up. Simon-Makuch methods properly account
      for the timing of exposure changes, providing unbiased survival estimates
      and valid statistical comparisons.

      dummy codes, grouped biomarkers, or structured predictors like gene
      pathways. The implementation supports overlapping groups, adaptive group
      weights, sparse group LASSO combining group and individual penalties, and
