    description: >-
      Performs comprehensive survival analysis with time-dependent variables
      using the Simon-Makuch method. This specialized analysis addresses the
      critical challenge of immortal time bias when studying treatments,
      biomarkers, or exposures that change during patient follow-up.

      **Clinical Applications:** - Treatment effectiveness when therapy timing
      varies (e.g., adjuvant therapy, targeted agents) - Biomarker evolution
      studies (e.g., mutation status, protein expression changes) - Disease
      progression impact on outcomes (e.g., metastasis development, grade
      progression) - Healthcare intervention timing effects (e.g., surgery,
      radiation, supportive care)

      **Key Statistical Methods:** - Simon-Makuch plots: Modified Kaplan-Meier
      curves for time-dependent exposures - Landmark analysis: Conditional
      survival from fixed time points - Time-dependent Cox regression: Hazard
      ratios accounting for exposure timing - Immortal time bias assessment:
      Comparison of naive vs. proper methods - Mantel-Byar testing: Specialized
      tests for time-dependent comparisons

      **Why Use Simon-Makuch Analysis:** Standard survival analysis assumes
      fixed baseline characteristics, leading to immortal time bias when
      exposures change during follow-up. Simon-Makuch methods properly account
      for the timing of exposure changes, providing unbiased survival estimates
      and valid statistical comparisons.

    description: >-
      Performs Q-TWiST (Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity)
      analysis to compare treatments while accounting for both quantity and
      quality of survival time. Particularly valuable in oncology trials where
      treatments may extend survival but with significant toxicity or disease
      symptoms.

      **What Q-TWiST Does:** Partitions overall survival into three health
      states with different quality-of-life weights: - TOX: Time with treatment
      toxicity (typically μ = 0-0.5) - TWiST: Time without symptoms or toxicity
      (μ = 1.0, perfect health) - REL: Time after disease relapse/progression
      (typically μ = 0-0.5)

      **Key Features:** - State-based survival partitioning with clinical
      significance - Utility weight application for quality adjustment -
      Sensitivity analysis across utility values - Bootstrap confidence
      intervals for treatment differences - Visual comparison with partitioned
      survival plots

      **Clinical Applications:** - Adjuvant therapy evaluation (balancing
      toxicity vs. benefit) - Treatment comparison when survival similar but
      quality differs - Shared decision-making (patient-relevant quality
      metrics) - Regulatory submissions (FDA/EMA recognized endpoint)

      partitioning. This method addresses the variable selection bias inherent
      in traditional CART by employing conditional inference procedures. The
      algorithm separates variable selection from splitting point selection,
      providing unbiased tree structures particularly valuable for survival data
      with mixed-type predictors and complex censoring patterns. Features
      include statistical significance-based stopping criteria, handling of 
      missing values without surrogate splits, and robust performance with
      correlated predictors. The method is particularly suitable for exploratory
      survival analysis and biomarker discovery in clinical research.

      reduced bias for non-zero coefficients. This implementation supports
      multiple weight calculation methods, cross-validation for optimal penalty
      selection, stability selection for robust variable identification, and
      comprehensive model diagnostics. Particularly effective for
      high-dimensional survival data where traditional methods fail, genomic

      which only considers positive vs negative, trichotomous ROC accounts for
      the clinically important indeterminate zone where additional testing may
      be required. The analysis provides 3×3 confusion matrices,
      category-specific sensitivities and specificities, volume under the ROC
      surface (VUS) as a 3D extension of AUC, and optimal threshold
      determination for each decision boundary. Particularly valuable for

    description: >
      Grey-zone ROC analysis for diagnostic tests where uncertainty around
      decision thresholds requires a "don't know" or "defer decision" option.
      Unlike traditional binary ROC that forces every case into positive or
      negative, grey-zone ROC acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty by creating an
      indeterminate zone around the threshold where additional testing or expert
      review is recommended. Essential for AI model deployment where uncertain
      predictions should not drive clinical decisions, cytology with atypical
      findings requiring repeat sampling, and biomarker cutoffs where borderline
      values need confirmation. The analysis determines optimal grey-zone
      boundaries that maximize diagnostic certainty while minimizing
      inconclusive results, calculates performance metrics excluding vs
      including grey-zone cases, and provides clinical decision rules for
      handling uncertain classifications. Particularly valuable for real-world
      implementation of diagnostic tests where "I don't know" is a valid and
      often safer response than forcing a potentially incorrect binary
      classification.

      or cancer stage (I/II/III/IV). Unlike binary ROC which dichotomizes
      outcomes, ordinal ROC preserves the natural ordering of categories and
      accounts for the severity/progression inherent in ordinal scales. The
      analysis uses cumulative probability models and proportional odds
      assumptions to generate ROC curves that reflect the ordinal nature of the
      outcome. Provides cumulative AUC across all thresholds, partial
      proportional odds models, and ordinal-specific performance metrics.
      Essential for biomarker validation in grading systems, staging algorithms,
      and any scenario where the outcome has more than 2 ordered levels.

      ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS: This is a BASIC implementation for single
      time-point Brier score evaluation. It requires PRE-COMPUTED survival
      probabilities (not raw Cox models). Many features listed below are NOT
      IMPLEMENTED or STATISTICALLY INVALID.

      Brier Score analysis evaluates calibration accuracy by measuring the mean
      squared difference between predicted survival probabilities and observed
      outcomes at a SINGLE specified time point. Lower Brier scores indicate
      better prediction accuracy (perfect prediction = 0, worst = 1). Includes
      scaled Brier scores relative to null model (Kaplan-Meier curve).

      ⚠️ NOT SUPPORTED: Multiple time points, Integrated Brier Score (IBS),
      competing risks, linear predictor inputs, formula inputs,
      temporal/external validation flags. These features may appear in the UI
      but will generate errors if used.

      For rigorous clinical validation, use established packages:
      riskRegression::Score() or pec::pec(). This implementation has NOT been

      Harrell's concordance index (C-index) for evaluating discrimination
      ability of survival prediction models. The C-index measures the proportion
      of all comparable pairs of patients in which the model correctly ranks
      their survival times - a generalization of the ROC curve's AUC to censored
      survival data. Values range from 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1.0 (perfect
      discrimination), with 0.7-0.8 considered good and >0.8 considered
      excellent. Unlike time-dependent ROC which evaluates at specific time
      points, the C-index provides a global measure across the entire follow-up
      period. Supports time-dependent concordance for dynamic predictions,
      competing risks extensions, stratified analysis, and comparison between
      models. Essential for validating Cox regression models, machine learning
      survival predictions, and prognostic scores. The C-index accounts for
      censoring through appropriate pair weighting and can be decomposed to
      identify which risk groups contribute most to discrimination.

      markers, imaging plus biomarker), 2D ROC analysis finds the optimal
      combined decision rule in two-dimensional marker space. Unlike analyzing
      markers separately and combining results, 2D ROC jointly optimizes both
      thresholds to maximize diagnostic accuracy. Provides joint
      sensitivity/specificity, optimal threshold pairs, 3D ROC surface
      visualization, and comparison to single-marker performance. Essential for

      marker alone is sufficient but combination improves diagnosis.
      Applications include ER/PR combinations, dual IHC (e.g., p16/Ki67),

      ROC regression for covariate-adjusted diagnostic accuracy assessment.
      Traditional ROC analysis assumes diagnostic test performance is constant
      across all patients, but accuracy often varies by patient characteristics
      (age, disease stage, scanner type, staining protocol). ROC regression
      models how sensitivity and specificity change as functions of covariates,
      providing covariate-specific ROC curves and adjusted summary measures
      (covariate-adjusted AUC). Essential for comparing diagnostic tests across
      heterogeneous populations, adjusting for confounders in test comparison
      studies, and identifying patient subgroups where tests perform
      differently. Particularly valuable in digital pathology for accounting for
      batch effects (different scanners, institutions, staining protocols) and
      in biomarker studies for age/stage-specific performance assessment. Uses
      binormal, non-parametric, or Bayesian approaches to model covariate
      effects on ROC curves. Provides both population-averaged and

      VUS calculates the volume under a 3D surface for multi-class problems. The
      VUS represents the probability that a randomly selected triple of
      observations (one from each class) will be correctly ordered by the
      diagnostic marker. VUS ranges from 0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates random
      classification (no discrimination), and 1 indicates perfect discrimination
      across all classes. This method is particularly valuable for tumor grading
      (Grade 1/2/3), disease staging (Stage I/II/III/IV), severity
      classification (mild/moderate/severe), and any diagnostic scenario where
      outcomes naturally fall into three or more ordered categories. The
      analysis provides pairwise AUC comparisons between adjacent classes,
      overall VUS with confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing against
      chance performance. Essential for validating biomarkers, imaging features,
      and AI models in multi-class clinicopathological applications where binary
      classification is insufficient.

    menuTitle: Precision-Recall Analysis
    menuSubtitle: PR curves for imbalanced datasets
    description: >
      Precision-Recall (PR) analysis is superior to ROC analysis for highly
      imbalanced datasets, which are common in digital pathology and AI
      applications. While ROC curves can be misleading when the negative class
      vastly outnumbers the positive class, PR curves focus on the performance
      in the minority (positive) class. The area under the PR curve (PR-AUC or
      Average Precision) provides a single-number summary of model performance.
      PR analysis is essential for evaluating rare event detection (mitotic
      figures <1%, rare tumor cells, micrometastases), cancer screening where
      positives are rare, quality control in digital pathology where defects are
      uncommon, and AI triage systems where abnormal cases are infrequent. This
      module provides comprehensive PR analysis with optimal threshold
      selection, comparison to baseline (random classifier), and F-score
      optimization for different precision-recall trade-offs.
