      Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards
      regression. In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is
      crucial for properly adjusting for covariates while accounting for varying
      observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates
      person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the
      instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying
      analyses or examining multiple predictors, the model accounts for how
      these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at risk in
      each subgroup.

    description: >-
      Performs comprehensive survival analysis with time-dependent variables
      using the Simon-Makuch method. This specialized analysis addresses the
      critical challenge of immortal time bias when studying treatments,
      biomarkers, or exposures that change during patient follow-up.

      **Clinical Applications:** - Treatment effectiveness when therapy timing
      varies (e.g., adjuvant therapy, targeted agents) - Biomarker evolution
      studies (e.g., mutation status, protein expression changes) - Disease
      progression impact on outcomes (e.g., metastasis development, grade
      progression) - Healthcare intervention timing effects (e.g., surgery,
      radiation, supportive care)

      **Key Statistical Methods:** - Simon-Makuch plots: Modified Kaplan-Meier
      curves for time-dependent exposures - Landmark analysis: Conditional
      survival from fixed time points - Time-dependent Cox regression: Hazard
      ratios accounting for exposure timing - Immortal time bias assessment:
      Comparison of naive vs. proper methods - Mantel-Byar testing: Specialized
      tests for time-dependent comparisons

      **Why Use Simon-Makuch Analysis:** Standard survival analysis assumes
      fixed baseline characteristics, leading to immortal time bias when
      exposures change during follow-up. Simon-Makuch methods properly account
      for the timing of exposure changes, providing unbiased survival estimates
      and valid statistical comparisons.
