    main: >-
        Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression.
        In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is crucial for properly adjusting
        for covariates while accounting for varying observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards
        model incorporates person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the instantaneous
        event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying analyses or examining multiple predictors,
        the model accounts for how these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at
        risk in each subgroup.
