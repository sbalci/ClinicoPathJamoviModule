    main: >
        Generalized pseudo-observations approach for survival analysis, competing risks, and other
        censored data problems. This method provides a flexible framework for analyzing survival
        outcomes using standard statistical methods by transforming survival data into pseudo-observations
        that can be analyzed with conventional regression techniques. Supports various functionals
        including survival probabilities, cumulative incidence functions, and restricted mean survival times.
