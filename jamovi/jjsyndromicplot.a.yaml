        Syndromic plots visualize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) loadings using
        a unique triangular design with directional arrows. This visualization method
        was developed by Ferguson et al. (2013) for interpreting complex disease patterns.

        Arrow width and color represent the magnitude and direction of variable loadings
        on the selected principal component. Only variables with loadings above the
        specified cutoff threshold are displayed.

        The triangle center displays the component label and variance accounted for (VAF).

            Select at least 3 numeric variables (e.g., biomarker levels, clinical measurements,
            gene expression values). PCA will identify patterns of correlation among these variables.
