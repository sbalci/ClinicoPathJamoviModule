    main: |
        Systematic evaluation of diagnostic test combinations. Analyzes all possible
        test result patterns (2-test: 4 patterns, 3-test: 8 patterns) against a gold
        standard to identify optimal testing strategies. Calculates sensitivity,
        specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for each pattern combination.
