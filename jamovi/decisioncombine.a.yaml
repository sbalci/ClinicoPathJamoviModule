        Analyzes and compares multiple medical diagnostic tests by examining all 
        possible test result combinations. This function evaluates how different 
        patterns of positive and negative test results perform against a gold 
        standard, helping clinicians understand which test combinations are most 
        informative. Shows individual test performance and comprehensive analysis 
        of all possible test result patterns (e.g., +/+, +/-, -/+, -/-) with 
        their respective positive predictive values and clinical interpretation. 
        Essential for understanding test interactions and optimizing diagnostic 
        strategies when multiple tests are available for the same condition.
