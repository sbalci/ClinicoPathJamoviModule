    Comprehensive date field correction and standardization using multiple R packages (datefixR, anytime, lubridate).
    This module handles messy date formats commonly found in clinical databases: different separators, 
    month representations, missing components, and ambiguous formats. Provides standardized date outputs
    with detailed correction reports and quality assessment. Perfect for clinical research data preprocessing
    and database standardization workflows.
  R:
    dontrun: true
    usage: |
      # Example:
      # 1. Select variables containing date information that need correction.
      # 2. Choose correction method (automatic detection or specific format).
      # 3. Configure missing value imputation settings.
      # 4. Review correction results and quality assessment.
