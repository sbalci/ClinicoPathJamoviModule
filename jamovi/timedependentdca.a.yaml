        Time-Dependent Decision Curve Analysis (tdDCA) extends standard DCA to
        evaluate the clinical utility of prognostic models with time-to-event outcomes.

        This method calculates net benefit at specific time points, accounting for
        censoring and time-varying risk predictions. It's essential for evaluating
        survival models, recurrence prediction models, and other longitudinal outcomes.

        Common applications: Serial biopsy surveillance, recurrence vs death prediction,
        time-varying treatment decisions.
