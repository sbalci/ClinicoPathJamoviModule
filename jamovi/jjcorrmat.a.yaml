#
# cor.vars.names
# Optional list of names to be used for cor.vars. The names should be entered in the same order.
#
# output
# Character that decides expected output from this function. If "plot", the visualization matrix will be returned. If "dataframe" (or literally anything other than "plot"), a dataframe containing all details from statistical analyses (e.g., correlation coefficients, statistic values, p-values, no. of observations, etc.) will be returned.
#
# matrix.type
# Character, "full" (default), "upper" or "lower", display full matrix, lower triangular or upper triangular matrix.
