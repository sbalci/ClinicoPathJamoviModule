    main: >-
        Performs univariate survival analysis comparing survival between groups. This analysis 
        calculates person-time follow-up for each group and uses this to derive accurate 
        survival estimates and incidence rates that account for varying follow-up durations 
        across groups. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates person-time by modeling 
        the hazard function, which represents the instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time.
