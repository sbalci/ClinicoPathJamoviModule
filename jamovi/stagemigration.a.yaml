    main: >-
      Comprehensive analysis for validating TNM staging system improvements using state-of-the-art 
      statistical methods. This analysis provides pathologists with robust tools to evaluate whether 
      a new staging system provides superior prognostic discrimination compared to existing systems.
      
      Includes advanced metrics: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI), Integrated Discrimination 
      Improvement (IDI), time-dependent ROC analysis, decision curve analysis, bootstrap validation, 
      and comprehensive clinical interpretation guidance.

          Perform tests for informative censoring to validate the assumption that
          censoring is non-informative. Informative censoring occurs when the
          censoring mechanism is related to the failure time, potentially biasing
          survival estimates. This analysis provides tests and adjustments for
          non-random censoring patterns.
