    main: Function for Odds Ratio Table and Plot.
    R:
        dontrun: true
        usage: |
            # example will be added

options:
    - name: data
      type: Data
      description:
          R: >
            The data as a data frame.

    - name: explanatory
      title: Explanatory Variables
      type: Variables
      suggested: [ nominal, continuous ]
      permitted: [ factor, numeric ]
      description:
          main: >
              The explanatory variables to be used in the analysis.
          R: >
              The explanatory variables to be used in the analysis.

    - name: outcome
      title: Mortality or Recurrence
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal ]
      permitted: [ factor ]
      description:
          main: >
              The outcome variable to be used in the analysis.
          R: >
              The outcome variable to be used in the analysis.

    - name: outcomeLevel
      title: Positive Outcome Level
      type: Level
      variable: (outcome)
      description:
          main: >
              Specify which outcome level represents the positive case (e.g., "Dead", "Event", "Yes").
              This is important for correct calculation of likelihood ratios and diagnostic metrics.
          R: >
            Specify which outcome level represents the positive case for likelihood ratio calculations.
            If not specified, the function will use the second level alphabetically.


# Nomogram ----

    - name: showNomogram
      title: Show Diagnostic Nomogram
      type: Bool
      default: false
      description:
          R: >
            Display an interactive nomogram for converting pre-test to post-test 
            probabilities using likelihood ratios calculated from the data.
