# Arguments
# data
# A dataframe (or a tibble) from which variables specified are to be taken. A matrix or tables will not be accepted.
#
# x
# The grouping variable from the dataframe data.
#
# y
# The response (a.k.a. outcome or dependent) variable from the dataframe data.
#
# plot.type
# Character describing the type of plot. Currently supported plots are "box" (for pure boxplots), "violin" (for pure violin plots), and "boxviolin" (for a combination of box and violin plots; default).
#
# type
# Type of statistic expected ("parametric" or "nonparametric" or "robust" or "bayes").Corresponding abbreviations are also accepted: "p" (for parametric), "np" (nonparametric), "r" (robust), or "bf"resp.
#
# pairwise.comparisons
# Logical that decides whether pairwise comparisons are to be displayed (default: TRUE). Please note that only significant comparisons will be shown by default. To change this behavior, select appropriate option with pairwise.display argument. The pairwise comparison dataframes are prepared using the pairwiseComparisons::pairwise_comparisons function. For more details about pairwise comparisons, see the documentation for that function.
#
# pairwise.display
# Decides which pairwise comparisons to display. Available options are "significant" (abbreviation accepted: "s") or "non-significant" (abbreviation accepted: "ns") or "everything"/"all". The default is "significant". You can use this argument to make sure that your plot is not uber-cluttered when you have multiple groups being compared and scores of pairwise comparisons being displayed.
#
# p.adjust.method
# Adjustment method for p-values for multiple comparisons. Possible methods are: "holm" (default), "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none".
#
# effsize.type
# Type of effect size needed for parametric tests. The argument can be "biased" (equivalent to "d" for Cohen's d for t-test; "eta" for partial eta-squared for anova) or "unbiased" (equivalent to "g" Hedge's g for t-test; "omega" for partial omega-squared for anova)).
#
# bf.prior
# A number between 0.5 and 2 (default 0.707), the prior width to use in calculating Bayes factors.
#
# bf.message
# Logical that decides whether to display Bayes Factor in favor of the null hypothesis. This argument is relevant only for parametric test (Default: TRUE).
#
# results.subtitle
# Decides whether the results of statistical tests are to be displayed as a subtitle (Default: TRUE). If set to FALSE, only the plot will be returned.
#
# xlab, ylab
# Labels for x and y axis variables. If NULL (default), variable names for x and y will be used.
#
# caption
# The text for the plot caption.
#
# title
# The text for the plot title.
#
# subtitle
# The text for the plot subtitle. Will work only if results.subtitle = FALSE.
#
# sample.size.label
# Logical that decides whether sample size information should be displayed for each level of the grouping variable x (Default: TRUE).
#
# k
# Number of digits after decimal point (should be an integer) (Default: k = 2L).
#
# var.equal
# a logical variable indicating whether to treat the variances in the samples as equal. If TRUE, then a simple F test for the equality of means in a one-way analysis of variance is performed. If FALSE, an approximate method of Welch (1951) is used, which generalizes the commonly known 2-sample Welch test to the case of arbitrarily many samples.
#
# conf.level
# Scalar between 0 and 1. If unspecified, the defaults return 95% confidence/credible intervals (0.95).
#
# nboot
# Number of bootstrap samples for computing confidence interval for the effect size (Default: 100).
#
# tr
# Trim level for the mean when carrying out robust tests. If you get error stating "Standard error cannot be computed because of Winsorized variance of 0 (e.g., due to ties). Try to decrease the trimming level.", try to play around with the value of tr, which is by default set to 0.1. Lowering the value might help.
#
# mean.plotting
# Logical that decides whether mean is to be highlighted and its value to be displayed (Default: TRUE).
#
# mean.ci
# Logical that decides whether 95% confidence interval for mean is to be displayed (Default: FALSE).
#
# mean.point.args, mean.label.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggplot2::geom_point and ggrepel::geom_label_repel geoms involved mean value plotting.
#
# notch
# A logical. If FALSE (default), a standard box plot will be displayed. If TRUE, a notched box plot will be used. Notches are used to compare groups; if the notches of two boxes do not overlap, this suggests that the medians are significantly different. In a notched box plot, the notches extend 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n). This gives a roughly 95% confidence interval for comparing medians. IQR: Inter-Quartile Range.
#
# notchwidth
# For a notched box plot, width of the notch relative to the body (default 0.5).
#
# outlier.tagging
# Decides whether outliers should be tagged (Default: FALSE).
#
# outlier.label
# Label to put on the outliers that have been tagged. This can't be the same as x argument.
#
# outlier.coef
# Coefficient for outlier detection using Tukey's method. With Tukey's method, outliers are below (1st Quartile) or above (3rd Quartile) outlier.coef times the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) (Default: 1.5).
#
# outlier.shape
# Hiding the outliers can be achieved by setting outlier.shape = NA. Importantly, this does not remove the outliers, it only hides them, so the range calculated for the y-axis will be the same with outliers shown and outliers hidden.
#
# outlier.color
# Default aesthetics for outliers (Default: "black").
#
# outlier.point.args, outlier.label.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggplot2::geom_point and ggrepel::geom_label_repel geoms involved outlier value plotting.
#
# point.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to the geom_point displaying the raw data.
#
# violin.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to the geom_violin.
#
# ggsignif.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggsignif::geom_signif.
#
# ggtheme
# A function, ggplot2 theme name. Default value is ggplot2::theme_bw(). Any of the ggplot2 themes, or themes from extension packages are allowed (e.g., ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(), hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps(), etc.).
#
# ggstatsplot.layer
# Logical that decides whether theme_ggstatsplot theme elements are to be displayed along with the selected ggtheme (Default: TRUE). theme_ggstatsplot is an opinionated theme layer that override some aspects of the selected ggtheme.
#
# package, palette
# Name of the package from which the given palette is to be extracted. The available palettes and packages can be checked by running View(paletteer::palettes_d_names).
#
# ggplot.component
# A ggplot component to be added to the plot prepared by ggstatsplot. This argument is primarily helpful for grouped_ variant of the current function. Default is NULL. The argument should be entered as a function.
#
# output
# Character that describes what is to be returned: can be "plot" (default) or "subtitle" or "caption". Setting this to "subtitle" will return the expression containing statistical results. If you have set results.subtitle = FALSE, then this will return a NULL. Setting this to "caption" will return the expression containing details about Bayes Factor analysis, but valid only when type = "parametric" and bf.message = TRUE, otherwise this will return a NULL. For functions ggpiestats and ggbarstats, setting output = "proptest" will return a dataframe containing results from proportion tests.
