    main: >
        Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for survival analysis providing
        flexible nonparametric modeling with automatic variable selection and
        interaction detection. BART combines an ensemble of weak learners (trees)
        with Bayesian priors to create a powerful predictive model that naturally
        handles nonlinear relationships, interactions, and variable selection
        without requiring preprocessing. The method provides full posterior
        distributions for predictions, built-in uncertainty quantification,
        and robust performance across diverse survival scenarios. Particularly
        effective for complex survival data with unknown functional forms,
        high-dimensional predictors, mixed variable types, and scenarios requiring
        individualized survival predictions with credible intervals. Implementation
        supports both accelerated failure time and proportional hazards formulations
        with comprehensive posterior inference and model diagnostics.
