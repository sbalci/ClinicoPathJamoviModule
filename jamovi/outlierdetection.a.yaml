  main: |
    Advanced outlier detection using multiple statistical methods from the easystats performance package.
    This module provides comprehensive outlier detection through univariate methods (Z-scores, IQR, confidence intervals),
    multivariate methods (Mahalanobis distance, MCD, OPTICS, LOF), and composite scoring across multiple algorithms.
    Complements existing data quality assessment modules with state-of-the-art outlier detection capabilities.
    Perfect for clinical research data quality control and preprocessing.

      # Example:
      # 1. Select variables for outlier detection analysis.
      # 2. Choose detection methods (univariate, multivariate, or composite).
      # 3. Configure thresholds and visualization options.
      # 4. Review outlier results and exclusion recommendations.

            Category of outlier detection methods to use. CLINICAL GUIDANCE: Univariate methods
            analyze each variable separately (ideal for lab values, vital signs). Multivariate
            methods consider relationships between variables (useful for correlated biomarkers).
            Composite combines multiple approaches for robust detection (recommended for most
            clinical data). Examples: Use univariate for hemoglobin levels, multivariate for
            complete blood count panels.

            for critical values like cardiac enzymes), 2.5 = 98.8% confidence (sensitive
            detection for research). Recommended: 3.29 for clinical quality control.
