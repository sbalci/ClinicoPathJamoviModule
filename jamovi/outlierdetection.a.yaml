  main: |
    Advanced outlier detection using multiple statistical methods from the easystats performance package.
    This module provides comprehensive outlier detection through univariate methods (Z-scores, IQR, confidence intervals),
    multivariate methods (Mahalanobis distance, MCD, OPTICS, LOF), and composite scoring across multiple algorithms.
    Complements existing data quality assessment modules with state-of-the-art outlier detection capabilities.
    Perfect for clinical research data quality control and preprocessing.

      # Example:
      # 1. Select variables for outlier detection analysis.
      # 2. Choose detection methods (univariate, multivariate, or composite).
      # 3. Configure thresholds and visualization options.
      # 4. Review outlier results and exclusion recommendations.
