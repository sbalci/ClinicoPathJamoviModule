        Population Health Analytics provides comprehensive cohort-level health status 
        monitoring and epidemiological analysis with population health metrics, risk 
        stratification, geographic health mapping, and predictive health outcome 
        modeling for public health surveillance, population management, and healthcare 
        system optimization through evidence-based population health insights.
