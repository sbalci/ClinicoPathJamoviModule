    main: >-
        Performs univariate survival analysis for multiple features to identify potential prognostic factors.
        This analysis runs a separate Cox proportional hazards model for each selected feature and ranks them
        by statistical significance, hazard ratio, or concordance index. Useful for biomarker screening,
        exploratory analysis, and feature selection before building multivariable models.
