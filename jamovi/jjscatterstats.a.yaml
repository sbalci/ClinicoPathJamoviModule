# Arguments
# data
# A dataframe (or a tibble) from which variables specified are to be taken. A matrix or tables will not be accepted.
#
# x
# The column in data containing the explanatory variable to be plotted on the x-axis. Can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "x") or as a bare expression (e.g, x).
#
# y
# The column in data containing the response (outcome) variable to be plotted on the y-axis. Can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "y") or as a bare expression (e.g, y).
#
# type
# Type of association between paired samples required (""parametric": Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient" or ""nonparametric": Spearman's rho" or ""robust": percentage bend correlation coefficient" or ""bayes": Bayes Factor for Pearson's r"). Corresponding abbreviations are also accepted: "p" (for parametric/pearson), "np" (nonparametric/spearman), "r" (robust), "bf" (for bayes factor), resp.
#
# conf.level
# Scalar between 0 and 1. If unspecified, the defaults return 95% confidence/credible intervals (0.95).
#
# bf.prior
# A number between 0.5 and 2 (default 0.707), the prior width to use in calculating Bayes factors.
#
# bf.message
# Logical that decides whether to display Bayes Factor in favor of the null hypothesis. This argument is relevant only for parametric test (Default: TRUE).
#
# beta
# bending constant (Default: 0.1). For more, see WRS2::pbcor().
#
# k
# Number of digits after decimal point (should be an integer) (Default: k = 2L).
#
# label.var
# Variable to use for points labels. Can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "var1") or as a bare expression (e.g, var1).
#
# label.expression
# An expression evaluating to a logical vector that determines the subset of data points to label. This argument can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "y < 4 & z < 20") or as a bare expression (e.g., y < 4 & z < 20).
#
# point.label.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggrepel::geom_label_repel geom used to display the labels.
#
# formula
# Formula to use in smoothing function, eg. y ~ x, y ~ poly(x, 2), y ~ log(x). NULL by default, in which case method = NULL implies formula = y ~ x when there are fewer than 1,000 observations and formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs") otherwise.
#
# smooth.line.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggplot2::geom_smooth geom used to display the regression line.
#
# method
# Smoothing method (function) to use, accepts either NULL or a character vector, e.g. "lm", "glm", "gam", "loess" or a function, e.g. MASS::rlm or mgcv::gam, stats::lm, or stats::loess. "auto" is also accepted for backwards compatibility. It is equivalent to NULL.
#
# For method = NULL the smoothing method is chosen based on the size of the largest group (across all panels). stats::loess() is used for less than 1,000 observations; otherwise mgcv::gam() is used with formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs") with method = "REML". Somewhat anecdotally, loess gives a better appearance, but is 𝑂(𝑁2)
# O
# (
# N
# 2
# )
#  in memory, so does not work for larger datasets.
#
# If you have fewer than 1,000 observations but want to use the same gam() model that method = NULL would use, then set method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs").
#
# method.args
# List of additional arguments passed on to the modelling function defined by method.
#
# point.args
# A list of additional aesthetic arguments to be passed to ggplot2::geom_point geom used to display the raw data points.
#
# point.width.jitter, point.height.jitter
# Degree of jitter in x and y direction, respectively. Defaults to 0 (0%) of the resolution of the data. Note that the jitter should not be specified in the point.args because this information will be passed to two different geoms: one displaying the points and the other displaying the labels for these points.
#
# marginal
# Decides whether ggExtra::ggMarginal() plots will be displayed; the default is TRUE.
#
# marginal.type
# Type of marginal distribution to be plotted on the axes ("histogram", "boxplot", "density", "violin", "densigram").
#
# margins
# Along which margins to show the plots. One of: [both, x, y].
#
# marginal.size
# Integer describing the relative size of the marginal plots compared to the main plot. A size of 5 means that the main plot is 5x wider and 5x taller than the marginal plots.
#
# xfill, yfill
# Character describing color fill for x and y axes marginal distributions (default: "#009E73" (for x) and "#D55E00" (for y)). Note that the defaults are colorblind-friendly.
#
# xparams
# List of extra parameters to use only for the marginal plot along the x axis.
#
# yparams
# List of extra parameters to use only for the marginal plot along the y axis.
#
# results.subtitle
# Decides whether the results of statistical tests are to be displayed as a subtitle (Default: TRUE). If set to FALSE, only the plot will be returned.
#
# xlab
# Labels for x and y axis variables. If NULL (default), variable names for x and y will be used.
#
# ylab
# Labels for x and y axis variables. If NULL (default), variable names for x and y will be used.
#
# title
# The text for the plot title.
#
# subtitle
# The text for the plot subtitle. Will work only if results.subtitle = FALSE.
#
# caption
# The text for the plot caption.
#
# ggtheme
# A function, ggplot2 theme name. Default value is ggplot2::theme_bw(). Any of the ggplot2 themes, or themes from extension packages are allowed (e.g., ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(), hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps(), etc.).
#
# ggstatsplot.layer
# Logical that decides whether theme_ggstatsplot theme elements are to be displayed along with the selected ggtheme (Default: TRUE). theme_ggstatsplot is an opinionated theme layer that override some aspects of the selected ggtheme.
#
# ggplot.component
# A ggplot component to be added to the plot prepared by ggstatsplot. This argument is primarily helpful for grouped_ variant of the current function. Default is NULL. The argument should be entered as a function.
#
# output

# A single grouping variable (can be entered either as a bare name x or as a string "x").
#

# Variable to use for points labels. Can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "var1") or as a bare expression (e.g, var1).

# An expression evaluating to a logical vector that determines the subset of data points to label. This argument can be entered either as a character string (e.g., "y < 4 & z < 20") or as a bare expression (e.g., y < 4 & z < 20).
#

# Character string specifying the prefix text for the fixed plot title (name of each factor level) (Default: NULL). If NULL, the variable name entered for grouping.var will be used.
