options:
    - name: data
      type: Data
      description:
          R: >
            The data as a data frame.

    - name: id
      title: ID Variable (optional)
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ nominal, ordinal ]
      default: NULL
      description:
          R: >
            Optional identifier for individual entities (e.g., patient ID, customer ID).
            Useful for tracking individual pathways through the flow diagram.
            Not required for aggregated flow visualization.

    - name: time
      title: Time/Sequence Variable
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal ]
      permitted: [ factor ]
      description:
          R: >
            Variable representing time points or sequential stages in the flow.
            Required for longitudinal river plots. Use ordered factors for
            proper time sequence (e.g., 'Baseline', 'Month_3', 'Month_6').
            Leave empty when using wide format data with multiple strata variables.

    - name: strata
      title: Strata Variables
      type: Variables
      suggested: [ ordinal, nominal ]
      permitted: [ factor ]
      description:
          R: >
            Variables containing the categories that flow between stages.
            For longitudinal data: single variable with categories (e.g., treatment_response).
            For wide format: multiple variables representing stages (e.g., baseline, month3, month6).
            Each variable should be a factor with meaningful category names.

    - name: weight
      title: Weight Variable (optional)
      type: Variable
      suggested: [ continuous ]
      permitted: [ numeric ]
      default: NULL
      description:
          R: >
            Optional numerical variable to determine stream width proportional to values.
            Examples: cost, patient count, revenue, frequency. If not provided,
            stream widths represent equal counts/frequencies. Use for emphasizing
            quantitative importance of different flows.

    - name: plotType
      title: Plot Type
      type: List
      options:
        - title: Alluvial
          name: alluvial
        - title: Sankey
          name: sankey
        - title: Stream
          name: stream
      default: alluvial
      description:
          R: >
            Type of flow visualization. 'alluvial' creates flowing streams between
            stages with curved connections, ideal for tracking transitions.
            'sankey' creates directed flow diagrams with straighter connections,
            good for process flows. 'stream' creates stacked area plots over time,
            suitable for showing composition changes.

    - name: fillType
      title: Fill Pattern
      type: List
      options:
        - title: By First Variable
          name: first
        - title: By Last Variable
          name: last
        - title: By Frequency
          name: frequency
      default: first
      description:
          R: >
            Determines how colors are assigned to flow streams. 'first' colors
            flows based on their initial category (useful for tracking origins).
            'last' colors by final category (useful for tracking destinations).
            'frequency' uses flow volume to determine colors (emphasizes major flows).

    - name: sortStreams
      title: Sort Streams
      type: Bool
      default: true
      description:
          R: >
            Whether to sort alluvial streams by frequency/size. When TRUE,
            larger flows are positioned more prominently, making major pathways
            easier to identify. Recommended for most analyses to highlight
            dominant patterns in the data.

    - name: labelNodes
      title: Label Nodes
      type: Bool
      default: true
      description:
          R: >
            Whether to display category labels on the nodes (vertical bars).
            Labels help identify what each segment represents. Recommended
            for most plots unless space is limited or labels would overlap.

    - name: curveType
      title: Curve Type
      type: List
      options:
        - title: Linear
          name: linear
        - title: Cardinal
          name: cardinal
        - title: Basis
          name: basis
        - title: Step
          name: step
      default: cardinal
      description:
          R: >
            Shape of connecting curves between stages. 'cardinal' creates smooth
            flowing curves (most aesthetic). 'linear' creates straight connections
            (clearest flow direction). 'basis' creates very smooth curves.
            'step' creates stepped connections (good for discrete processes).

    - name: showCounts
      title: Show Counts
      type: Bool
      default: false
      description:
          R: >
            Whether to display numerical counts or values on the nodes.
            Shows exact frequencies or sums for each category at each stage.
            Useful for precise quantitative interpretation but may clutter
            the visualization if many categories are present.

    - name: showLegend
      title: Show Legend
      type: Bool
      default: true
      description:
          R: >
            Whether to display the color legend explaining category mappings.
            Recommended when colors represent meaningful categories. Can be
            hidden to save space if category labels are clearly visible
            on the diagram itself.

    - name: mytitle
      title: Title
      type: String
      default: ''
      description:
          R: >
            Main title for the river plot. Should describe the flow being visualized
            (e.g., 'Patient Treatment Pathways Over Time', 'Customer Journey Analysis').
            Leave empty for no title.

    - name: xtitle
      title: X-Title
      type: String
      default: ''
      description:
          R: >
            Label for the x-axis, typically describing the time dimension or stages
            (e.g., 'Study Timepoint', 'Process Stage', 'Academic Year').
            Leave empty to use variable name.

    - name: ytitle
      title: Y-Title
      type: String
      default: ''
      description:
          R: >
            Label for the y-axis, typically describing the quantity being measured
            (e.g., 'Number of Patients', 'Frequency', 'Cost ($)').
            Leave empty to use default based on weight variable.

    - name: originaltheme
      title: Use ggStatsPlot Theme
      type: Bool
      default: false
      description:
          R: >
            Whether to apply ggStatsPlot styling instead of jamovi's default theme.
            ggStatsPlot theme provides statistical-publication ready formatting.
            Default jamovi theme integrates better with other jamovi analyses.
