            number of bootstrap replicates for confidence intervals
          ui: >
            Number of bootstrap samples for robust confidence intervals. 1000 samples (default) provides
            reliable estimates for most studies. Increase to 5000+ for high-stakes validation studies.
            Example: FDA biomarker qualification typically uses 2000+ samples.

            type of intraclass correlation coefficient to calculate
          ui: >
            CONSISTENCY (Default): Assesses if methods rank samples similarly. Use for biomarker scoring
            reproducibility (Ki67, ER, PR, HER2) where relative ranking matters more than exact values.

            ABSOLUTE AGREEMENT: Assesses if methods give identical values. Use for diagnostic cutoffs
            or when exact numerical concordance is critical (e.g., reference range validation).

            Clinical Guidance:
            • Biomarker scoring studies → Consistency
            • Diagnostic cutoff validation → Absolute Agreement
            • Platform comparison studies → Consistency
            • Method substitution studies → Absolute Agreement

      description:
          R: >
            correlation method(s) to calculate
          ui: >
            Pearson correlation assumes normal distribution and linear relationships. Spearman rank
            correlation is robust to outliers and non-normal distributions. Both (default) provides
            comprehensive assessment for most digital pathology studies.
