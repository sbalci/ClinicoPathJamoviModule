description:
    main: >-
        Performs survival analysis with time-dependent variables using the Simon-Makuch method.
        This analysis is specifically designed for situations where patient characteristics or
        treatments change during follow-up, such as biomarker changes, treatment switches,
        or progression events. The Simon-Makuch approach properly accounts for these
        time-varying exposures in survival estimation and comparison.
        
        Key features include Simon-Makuch plots (modified Kaplan-Meier curves), landmark
        analysis, time-dependent Cox regression, and proper handling of immortal time bias.
