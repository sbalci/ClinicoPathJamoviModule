description:
    main: >-
        Performs comprehensive survival analysis with time-dependent variables using the Simon-Makuch method.
        This specialized analysis addresses the critical challenge of immortal time bias when studying
        treatments, biomarkers, or exposures that change during patient follow-up.
        
        **Clinical Applications:**
        - Treatment effectiveness when therapy timing varies (e.g., adjuvant therapy, targeted agents)
        - Biomarker evolution studies (e.g., mutation status, protein expression changes)
        - Disease progression impact on outcomes (e.g., metastasis development, grade progression)
        - Healthcare intervention timing effects (e.g., surgery, radiation, supportive care)
        
        **Key Statistical Methods:**
        - Simon-Makuch plots: Modified Kaplan-Meier curves for time-dependent exposures
        - Landmark analysis: Conditional survival from fixed time points
        - Time-dependent Cox regression: Hazard ratios accounting for exposure timing
        - Immortal time bias assessment: Comparison of naive vs. proper methods
        - Mantel-Byar testing: Specialized tests for time-dependent comparisons
        
        **Why Use Simon-Makuch Analysis:**
        Standard survival analysis assumes fixed baseline characteristics, leading to immortal time bias
        when exposures change during follow-up. Simon-Makuch methods properly account for the timing
        of exposure changes, providing unbiased survival estimates and valid statistical comparisons.
