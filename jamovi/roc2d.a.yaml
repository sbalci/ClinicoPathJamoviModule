description:
    main: >
        Two-dimensional ROC analysis for evaluating diagnostic accuracy of dual biomarker
        combinations or multi-parametric tests. When two biomarkers are measured simultaneously
        (e.g., ER and PR in breast cancer, dual IHC markers, imaging plus biomarker),
        2D ROC analysis finds the optimal combined decision rule in two-dimensional
        marker space. Unlike analyzing markers separately and combining results, 2D
        ROC jointly optimizes both thresholds to maximize diagnostic accuracy. Provides
        joint sensitivity/specificity, optimal threshold pairs, 3D ROC surface visualization,
        and comparison to single-marker performance. Essential for multiplex assays,
        dual biomarker panels, and situations where neither marker alone is sufficient
        but combination improves diagnosis. Applications include ER/PR combinations,
        dual IHC (e.g., p16/Ki67), imaging radiomics plus molecular markers, and
        any scenario with two continuous diagnostic measurements.
