    main: >-
      Calculates power, sample size, or minimum detectable hazard ratio for survival studies.
      This helps researchers design adequately powered studies to detect meaningful differences
      in survival between groups.

            require actual data - it's used for study planning.

        Select what to calculate. 'Power' calculates statistical power given sample size
        and hazard ratio. 'Sample Size' determines required sample size for desired power
        and hazard ratio. 'Hazard Ratio' calculates the minimum detectable effect size
        given sample size and power.
