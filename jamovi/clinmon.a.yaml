description:
    main: >-
        Calculates hemodynamic indices from continuous clinical monitoring data.
        Uses the clintools package to compute COest, CPPopt, CVRi, Dx, Mx, PI, PRx, PWA, RI, and Sx
        from continuous recordings of arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, 
        middle cerebral artery blood velocity, and heart rate.

      default: 1000
      description: >-
        Frequency of recorded data in Hz. Default is 1000 Hz for high-resolution
        monitoring systems. Adjust based on your data collection frequency.

    - name: blocksize
      title: 'Block Size (seconds)'
      type: Integer
      min: 1
