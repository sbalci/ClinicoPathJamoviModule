description:
    main: >-
        Calculates hemodynamic indices from continuous clinical monitoring data.
        Uses the clintools package to compute COest, CPPopt, CVRi, Dx, Mx, PI, PRx, PWA, RI, and Sx
        from continuous recordings of arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, 
        middle cerebral artery blood velocity, and heart rate.
