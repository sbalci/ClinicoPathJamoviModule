    main: >
        Comprehensive validation metrics for image segmentation tasks in digital pathology
        and AI-based tissue analysis. Evaluates overlap and boundary accuracy between
        AI-predicted segmentations and expert-annotated ground truth. Essential metrics
        include Dice Coefficient (F1-score for spatial overlap), Jaccard Index (IoU -
        Intersection over Union), Hausdorff Distance (maximum boundary deviation), and
        Surface Distance metrics. Designed for tumor boundary delineation, gland segmentation,
        cell nuclei detection, tissue region classification, and any pixel-level or
        region-based segmentation task. Supports binary segmentation (single structure),
        multi-class segmentation (multiple tissue types), and instance segmentation
        (individual object detection). Provides statistical analysis across multiple
        images, stratification by image characteristics (magnification, staining, scanner),
        and clinical interpretation of segmentation quality. Critical for validating
        AI algorithms before deployment in diagnostic workflows, comparing segmentation
        methods, and establishing performance benchmarks for digital pathology systems.
