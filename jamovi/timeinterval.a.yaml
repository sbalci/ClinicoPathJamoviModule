    main: >-
        Advanced time interval calculator designed for survival analysis, epidemiological studies, 
        and person-time analysis. Features intelligent date parsing, comprehensive data quality 
        assessment, landmark analysis, and robust statistical summaries. Time intervals form the 
        foundation of person-time follow-up calculations, capturing both participant counts and 
        observation duration for accurate incidence rate calculations.

              output_unit = "months"
            )
            
            # With landmark analysis:
            timeinterval(
