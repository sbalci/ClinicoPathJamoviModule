        'Creates waffle charts to visualize categorical distributions and proportions using colored squares. Ideal for showing parts-of-whole relationships in clinical data such as disease subtypes, treatment outcomes, or risk category distributions. Each square represents a proportion of the total sample, making it easy to see relative frequencies across categories.'

options:
    - name: data
      type: Data

            The data as a data frame.

          R: >
            Optional numeric weight variable if cases have different weights. Leave empty to count each row equally (recommended for most clinical data). Only needed if your data is pre-aggregated or weighted.

    - name: groups

      permitted: [ factor ]
      description:
          R: >
            The categorical grouping variable for the waffle squares. Each category will be displayed as proportional colored squares in a 10x10 grid. Examples: Tumor grade (G1/G2/G3), Treatment outcome (Complete/Partial/No response), Risk categories (Low/Medium/High).

    - name: facet
      title: Facet By (Optional)

      description:
          R: >
            Optional variable to split the waffle chart by another categorical variable to compare distributions across subgroups (e.g., by treatment arm, patient cohort, or time period). Creates separate waffle charts for each level.
