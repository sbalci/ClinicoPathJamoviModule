        Calculates the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and False Discovery Rate (FDR)
        for research findings based on study characteristics. This tool helps researchers
        understand the probability that their significant findings are actually true,
        considering factors like prior probability, statistical power, and research biases.

      default: 50
      description: >-
          The pre-study probability that the tested relationships are true.
          In exploratory research fields, this may be 10% or lower.
          In confirmatory research with strong theoretical basis, it may be higher.

      type: Number

      max: 0.1
      default: 0.05
      description: >-
          The significance level (Type I error rate) used in the studies.
          Standard value is 0.05, but may be lower for multiple testing situations.

    - name: power
      title: "Power (1-&beta;)"
      type: Number
      min: 0.01
      max: 0.99
      default: 0.8
      description: >-
          Statistical power of the studies to detect true effects.
          Well-designed studies typically have 80% power or higher.
          Many published studies have much lower actual power.

    - name: percHack
      title: "Percentage of p-hacked studies"
      type: Integer
      min: 0
      max: 100
      default: 0
      description: >-
          Percentage of studies with questionable research practices (p-hacking,
          selective reporting, data dredging). This represents bias in the
          research process that increases false positive rates.
