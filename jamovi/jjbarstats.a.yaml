Setting this to "caption" will return the expression containing details about Bayes Factor analysis, but valid only when type = "parametric" and bf.message = TRUE, otherwise this will return a NULL. For functions ggpiestats and ggbarstats, setting output = "proptest" will return a dataframe containing results from proportion tests.

# Arguments
# data
# A dataframe (or a tibble) from which variables specified are to be taken. A matrix or tables will not be accepted.
#
# x
# The variable to use as the rows in the contingency table.
#
# y
# The variable to use as the columns in the contingency table. Default is NULL. If NULL, one-sample proportion test (a goodness of fit test) will be run for the x variable. Otherwise an appropriate association test will be run. This argument can not be NULL for ggbarstats function.
#
# counts
# A string naming a variable in data containing counts, or NULL if each row represents a single observation.
#
# ratio
# A vector of proportions: the expected proportions for the proportion test (should sum to 1). Default is NULL, which means the null is equal theoretical proportions across the levels of the nominal variable. This means if there are two levels this will be ratio = c(0.5,0.5) or if there are four levels this will be ratio = c(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25), etc.
#
# paired

# results.subtitle
# Decides whether the results of statistical tests are to be displayed as a subtitle (Default: TRUE). If set to FALSE, only the plot will be returned.
#
# sample.size.label
# Logical that decides whether sample size information should be displayed for each level of the grouping variable y (Default: TRUE).

#
# label.args
# Additional aesthetic arguments that will be passed to geom_label.

#
# fixed.margin
# For the independent multinomial sampling plan, which margin is fixed ("rows" or "cols"). Defaults to "rows".

#
# ggplot.component
# A ggplot component to be added to the plot prepared by ggstatsplot. This argument is primarily helpful for grouped_ variant of the current function. Default is NULL. The argument should be entered as a function.
