    main: >
        Brier Score analysis for evaluating calibration accuracy of survival probability
        predictions. The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between predicted
        survival probabilities and observed outcomes at specific time points, providing
        a comprehensive assessment of both discrimination and calibration. Lower Brier
        scores indicate better prediction accuracy (perfect prediction = 0, worst = 1).
        The Integrated Brier Score (IBS) extends this by integrating the time-dependent
        Brier score across the follow-up period, providing a single summary measure of
        overall prediction performance. Includes scaled Brier scores relative to null
        model (KM curve) and comparison to reference models. Essential for validating
        Cox regression models, machine learning survival predictions, and risk calculators.
        Particularly valuable for clinical prediction models where accurate probability
        estimates are critical for patient counseling and treatment decisions. Supports
        external validation, temporal validation, and competing risks scenarios.
