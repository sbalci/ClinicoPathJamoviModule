        Volume Under ROC Surface (VUS) analysis extends the traditional Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
        to diagnostic tests with three or more ordered classes. While binary ROC analysis calculates
        the area under a 2D curve, VUS calculates the volume under a 3D surface for multi-class problems.
        The VUS represents the probability that a randomly selected triple of observations (one from
        each class) will be correctly ordered by the diagnostic marker. VUS ranges from 0 to 1, where
        0.5 indicates random classification (no discrimination), and 1 indicates perfect discrimination
        across all classes. This method is particularly valuable for tumor grading (Grade 1/2/3),
        disease staging (Stage I/II/III/IV), severity classification (mild/moderate/severe), and any
        diagnostic scenario where outcomes naturally fall into three or more ordered categories.
        The analysis provides pairwise AUC comparisons between adjacent classes, overall VUS with
        confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing against chance performance. Essential for
        validating biomarkers, imaging features, and AI models in multi-class clinicopathological
        applications where binary classification is insufficient.
