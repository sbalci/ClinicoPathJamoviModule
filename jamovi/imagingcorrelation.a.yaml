        Imaging Findings Correlation provides comprehensive multi-modal diagnostic 
        data integration by correlating imaging findings with laboratory results, 
        clinical presentations, and pathological data for enhanced diagnostic 
        accuracy and clinical decision support through evidence-based pattern 
        recognition and cross-modality validation.
