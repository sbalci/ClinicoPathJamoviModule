        Performs SEQUENTIAL permutation-based significance testing to determine which principal
        components explain more variance than expected by random chance. This provides
        an objective, hypothesis-tested approach to component retention.

        The test uses the Buja & Eyuboglu (1992) sequential method where:
        1. Each component is tested against a permutation null distribution
        2. Significant components have their variance REMOVED before testing the next component
        3. Testing STOPS when the first non-significant component is found

        This sequential approach prevents inflated Type I errors that occur when all components
        are tested against the same null distribution (batch testing).

        CRITICAL: Requires centered and scaled data for valid correlation-based interpretation.
        Without centering/scaling, the test compares raw variance instead of correlation structure.
