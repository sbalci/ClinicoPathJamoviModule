    main: |
        Legacy power analysis and sample size calculation for survival studies using Lachin-Foulkes and
        Schoenfeld methods from gsDesign package.

        This is the original survival power analysis function. For enhanced functionality including
        competing risks, RMST analysis, and additional methods, also consider 'Comprehensive Survival Power Analysis'.
