    main: >
        Group LASSO for Cox proportional hazards models enabling simultaneous
        selection of pre-defined variable groups while maintaining within-group
        structure. This method extends traditional LASSO by applying penalties
        at the group level, making it ideal for categorical variables with
        multiple dummy codes, grouped biomarkers, or structured predictors like
        gene pathways. The implementation supports overlapping groups, adaptive
        group weights, sparse group LASSO combining group and individual penalties,
        and comprehensive cross-validation for optimal penalty selection.
        Particularly valuable for genomic survival analysis, clinical prediction
        models with natural variable groupings, and scenarios requiring
        interpretable group-wise feature selection with preserved biological
        or clinical structure.
