    main: >
        ROC regression for covariate-adjusted diagnostic accuracy assessment. Traditional
        ROC analysis assumes diagnostic test performance is constant across all patients,
        but accuracy often varies by patient characteristics (age, disease stage, scanner
        type, staining protocol). ROC regression models how sensitivity and specificity
        change as functions of covariates, providing covariate-specific ROC curves and
        adjusted summary measures (covariate-adjusted AUC). Essential for comparing
        diagnostic tests across heterogeneous populations, adjusting for confounders
        in test comparison studies, and identifying patient subgroups where tests
        perform differently. Particularly valuable in digital pathology for accounting
        for batch effects (different scanners, institutions, staining protocols) and
        in biomarker studies for age/stage-specific performance assessment. Uses
        binormal, non-parametric, or Bayesian approaches to model covariate effects
        on ROC curves. Provides both population-averaged and covariate-specific
        diagnostic accuracy estimates.
