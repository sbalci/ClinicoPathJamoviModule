description:
    main: |
        Creates waterfall and spider plots to analyze tumor response data following RECIST criteria.
        
        Supports both raw tumor measurements and pre-calculated percentage changes.
        Provides comprehensive response analysis including ORR, DCR, and person-time metrics.

    - name: data
      type: Data

      type: Variable
      suggested: [nominal]

      description:
          R: >
            Variable containing patient identifiers (e.g., PT001, Patient_1, Study_ID).
            Each patient should have a unique identifier for proper analysis.
          jamovi: >
            Variable containing patient identifiers (e.g., PT001, Patient_1, Study_ID).

    - name: responseVar
      title: Response Value (Raw or Percentage)
      type: Variable
      suggested: [continuous]
      permitted: [numeric]
      description:
          R: >
            Response variable: either raw tumor measurements (mm, cm, sum of diameters) or
            pre-calculated percentage changes from baseline.
            For raw measurements: requires time variable with baseline at time = 0.
            For percentages: negative values = tumor shrinkage (good response),
            positive values = tumor growth (poor response). Example: -30 means 30% decrease.
          jamovi: >
            Response variable: tumor measurements or percentage changes from baseline.
            • Raw measurements: actual tumor sizes (mm, cm, sum of diameters)
            • Percentage changes: pre-calculated changes (-30 = 30% shrinkage = good response)
            Tip: Use percentage format if changes already calculated, raw format for actual measurements.


    - name: timeVar
      title: Time Variable (Required for Spider Plot)
      type: Variable

            Time point of measurement (e.g., months from baseline, days from treatment start).
            Required for spider plot and raw measurement processing. Baseline should be time = 0.
          jamovi: >
            Time point of measurement for tracking response over time.
            • Examples: months from baseline, weeks from treatment start
            • Required for: Spider plot visualization and raw measurement processing
            • Format: Baseline = 0, follow-up = positive numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
            Tip: Spider plots show treatment response trajectories over time.

          name: raw
      default: percentage
      description:
          R: >
            Specify data format: 'raw' for actual tumor measurements (requires time variable)
            or 'percentage' for pre-calculated percentage changes from baseline
          jamovi: >
            Choose your data format:
            • Percentage Changes: Pre-calculated changes from baseline (-30 = 30% shrinkage)
            • Raw Measurements: Actual tumor sizes (requires Time Variable for baseline calculation)
            Most oncology studies use percentage changes. Use raw measurements only if you have
            actual tumor measurements and want automatic percentage calculation.
