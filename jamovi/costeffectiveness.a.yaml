        Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) for evaluating the economic value of diagnostic
        tests, screening programs, and clinical decision strategies. Calculates Incremental
        Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which represents the additional cost per additional
        unit of effectiveness (e.g., cost per correct diagnosis, cost per QALY gained).
        The analysis compares new diagnostic strategies against standard of care or alternative
        approaches, visualizing results on the cost-effectiveness plane and calculating net
        monetary benefit at various willingness-to-pay thresholds. Essential for health
        technology assessment, budget impact analysis, and justifying adoption of new
        diagnostic technologies such as multiplex IHC, AI-assisted pathology, digital
        pathology platforms, and molecular tests. Supports deterministic sensitivity analysis
        (tornado plots) to identify key cost drivers and probabilistic sensitivity analysis
        (Monte Carlo simulation) to quantify uncertainty in cost-effectiveness conclusions.
        Particularly valuable for demonstrating value proposition of advanced diagnostics
        to hospital administrators, payers, and policy makers.
