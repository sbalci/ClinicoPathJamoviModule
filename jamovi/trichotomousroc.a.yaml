    main: >
        Trichotomous ROC analysis for three-category diagnostic tests with positive,
        indeterminate (grey zone), and negative outcomes. Essential for biomarker
        scoring systems like HER2 (0-1+/2+/3+), PD-L1 expression levels, and cytology
        classifications with "atypical" results. Unlike binary ROC which only considers
        positive vs negative, trichotomous ROC accounts for the clinically important
        indeterminate zone where additional testing may be required. The analysis
        provides 3×3 confusion matrices, category-specific sensitivities and specificities,
        volume under the ROC surface (VUS) as a 3D extension of AUC, and optimal threshold
        determination for each decision boundary. Particularly valuable for establishing
        clinical cutoffs in molecular pathology where grey-zone results trigger reflex
        testing (e.g., HER2 2+ requires FISH confirmation).
