        Comprehensive meta-analysis for treatment effects in clinical research.
        Supports continuous outcomes (mean differences, standardized mean differences),
        binary outcomes (risk ratios, odds ratios, risk differences), and time-to-event
        outcomes (hazard ratios). Includes fixed-effect, random-effects, and Bayesian
        meta-analysis approaches with comprehensive heterogeneity assessment and
        publication bias evaluation.
