    main: >-
        Visualizes patient similarity using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, MDS).
        Projects high-dimensional patient data into 2D or 3D space to reveal natural patient groupings
        and subpopulations. Inspired by Orange Data Mining's interactive projection widgets, adapted for
        jamovi with comprehensive cluster analysis and statistical validation.

      type: List
      options:
        - title: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

            Method for dimensionality reduction:
            - PCA: Linear method, preserves global structure
            - t-SNE: Non-linear, excellent for visualization, preserves local structure
            - UMAP: Non-linear, preserves both local and global structure, faster than t-SNE
            - MDS: Classical method, preserves pairwise distances

# Dimensions ----

    - name: dimensions
      title: Number of Dimensions
      type: List
      options:

      default: '2'
      description:
          R: >

      default: NULL
      description:
          R: >
            Variable to use for coloring points. Typically an outcome variable
            (e.g., disease status, survival, response) to see if it corresponds

            nearest neighbors considered. Typical values: 5-50. Higher values
            preserve more global structure.
