            hotspot area, or overall tumor measurement. Leave empty for inter-regional comparison studies.
            Example: Ki67 proliferation index (0-100%), ER H-score (0-300), PR percentage (0-100%).

      description:
          R: >
            Coefficient of variation threshold for acceptable sampling variability.
            Typical clinical values: 15-25% for immunohistochemistry (Ki67, ER, PR),
            10-20% for molecular assays, 20-30% for heterogeneous markers (HER2, PD-L1).
            Lower values indicate more stringent quality requirements.

      description:

            Minimum Spearman correlation between biopsy and whole section measurements.
            Clinical guidelines: ≥0.80 excellent agreement, ≥0.70 good agreement,
            ≥0.60 moderate agreement, <0.60 poor agreement.
            Higher values indicate better representativeness of biopsy samples.
