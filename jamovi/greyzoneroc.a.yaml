    main: >
        Grey-zone ROC analysis for diagnostic tests where uncertainty around decision
        thresholds requires a "don't know" or "defer decision" option. Unlike traditional
        binary ROC that forces every case into positive or negative, grey-zone ROC
        acknowledges diagnostic uncertainty by creating an indeterminate zone around
        the threshold where additional testing or expert review is recommended. Essential
        for AI model deployment where uncertain predictions should not drive clinical
        decisions, cytology with atypical findings requiring repeat sampling, and
        biomarker cutoffs where borderline values need confirmation. The analysis
        determines optimal grey-zone boundaries that maximize diagnostic certainty
        while minimizing inconclusive results, calculates performance metrics excluding
        vs including grey-zone cases, and provides clinical decision rules for handling
        uncertain classifications. Particularly valuable for real-world implementation
        of diagnostic tests where "I don't know" is a valid and often safer response
        than forcing a potentially incorrect binary classification.
