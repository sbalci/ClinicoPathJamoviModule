description:
    main: >-
      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group comparisons.
      The analysis calculates total person-time follow-up (the sum of all individual 
      observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate survival estimates that account 
      for varying follow-up durations. Use this when you want to analyze overall survival 
      characteristics of your entire study population - for example, to determine median 
      survival time or 1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.
