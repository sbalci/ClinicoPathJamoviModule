# Overview {#sec-overview}

This tutorial teaches you how to create **publication-ready Table One** for clinical trial manuscripts, including:

- ✅ Baseline characteristics stratified by treatment group
- ✅ Statistical tests comparing groups
- ✅ Effect sizes and confidence intervals
- ✅ Multiple testing corrections
- ✅ Publication-quality formatting

**Prerequisites:** [Tutorial 1: Getting Started](01-getting-started.qmd)
**Time Required:** 45 minutes
**Dataset:** `clinical_trial_data` (n=200, 2 treatment groups)

---

# Clinical Scenario {#sec-scenario}

## Study Design

You conducted a **randomized controlled trial** comparing two treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer:

- **Control Group (n=100)**: Standard trastuzumab + chemotherapy
- **Experimental Group (n=100)**: New dual HER2 blockade + chemotherapy

**Primary Endpoint:** Progression-free survival (PFS)
**Secondary Endpoints:** Overall survival, response rate, toxicity

##

 Manuscript Requirements

Journal guidelines require Table One showing:

1. ✅ Baseline patient demographics (age, sex, race, BMI)
2. ✅ Tumor characteristics (stage, grade, size, ER/PR/HER2 status)
3. ✅ Prior treatments (surgery, radiation)
4. ✅ Comparison between groups with statistical tests
5. ✅ P-values and effect sizes
6. ✅ Missing data transparency

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Principle
In RCTs, baseline characteristics should be **similar between groups**. Large imbalances suggest randomization failure or selection bias.

# Step-by-Step Analysis {#sec-analysis}

## Step 1: Load Clinical Trial Data

1. Open jamovi
2. Click **File** → **Open**
3. Select **Data Library**
4. Choose `clinical_trial_data`

**Dataset Structure:**

| Variable | Type | Values | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| `PatientID` | ID | PT001-PT200 | Patient identifier |
| `TreatmentGroup` | Nominal | Control / Experimental | Randomization arm |
| `Age` | Continuous | 25-75 years | Age at enrollment |
| `Sex` | Nominal | Male / Female | Biological sex |
| `Race` | Nominal | White / Black / Asian / Other | Self-reported race |
| `BMI` | Continuous | 18-42 kg/m² | Body mass index |
| `ECOG_Status` | Ordinal | 0 / 1 / 2 | Performance status |
| `TumorStage` | Ordinal | I / II / III / IV | TNM stage |
| `TumorGrade` | Ordinal | 1 / 2 / 3 | Histologic grade |
| `TumorSize` | Continuous | 0.5-12.0 cm | Tumor diameter |
| `ER_Status` | Nominal | Positive / Negative | Estrogen receptor |
| `PR_Status` | Nominal | Positive / Negative | Progesterone receptor |
| `HER2_Status` | Nominal | Positive / Negative | HER2 amplification |
| `PriorSurgery` | Nominal | Yes / No | Prior surgical resection |
| `PriorRadiation` | Nominal | Yes / No | Prior radiotherapy |

## Step 2: Open Cross Tables Analysis

For **group comparisons**, use **Cross Tables** instead of basic Table One:

1. Click **Analyses** → **ExplorationT1**
2. Choose **Cross Tables**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why Cross Tables?
Cross Tables provides:
- ✅ Stratification by group
- ✅ Automatic statistical tests
- ✅ Effect sizes
- ✅ Multiple table styles (including New England Journal of Medicine format)
:::

## Step 3: Configure the Analysis

### Variables Section

**Explanatory (Row) Variables:**
Drag these to the **Rows** box:
- Age
- Sex
- Race
- BMI
- ECOG_Status
- TumorStage
- TumorGrade
- TumorSize
- ER_Status
- PR_Status
- PriorSurgery
- PriorRadiation

**Outcome (Column) Variable:**
Drag to the **Columns** box:
- TreatmentGroup

::: {.callout-note}
## Variable Roles
- **Rows** = Baseline characteristics you want to summarize
- **Columns** = Groups you want to compare (treatment arms)
:::

### Table Style

Choose your preferred style:

| Style | Format | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **NEJM** | New England Journal of Medicine | High-impact medical journals |
| **Lancet** | The Lancet format | European journals |
| **arsenal** | R arsenal package | Comprehensive reports |
| **finalfit** | finalfit package | Quick summaries |
| **gtsummary** | Modern publication | General medical journals |

**For this tutorial:** Select **`NEJM`** for maximum impact.

### Statistics Options

**Tests** section:

- ☑ **Include p-values**: Shows statistical significance
- ☑ **Include test names**: Transparency about which test was used
- ☑ **Include effect sizes**: Cohen's d, Cramér's V, etc.

**Automatic Test Selection:**

ClinicoPath automatically chooses appropriate tests:

| Variable Type | Test Used | When |
|---------------|-----------|------|
| Continuous, normal, 2 groups | Independent t-test | Default for age, BMI, tumor size |
| Continuous, non-normal, 2 groups | Mann-Whitney U | If normality violated |
| Categorical, 2 groups | Chi-square | For sex, stage, grade |
| Categorical, small sample | Fisher's exact | If expected count < 5 |
| Ordinal, 2 groups | Wilcoxon rank-sum | For ECOG, stage, grade |

**Multiple Testing Correction:**

- ☐ None - Raw p-values (standard for Table One)
- ☑ Bonferroni - Conservative correction
- ☑ Holm - Less conservative
- ☑ Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) - Control false discovery rate

::: {.callout-warning}
## Multiple Testing in Table One
Most journals do NOT require correction for Table One baseline comparisons in RCTs, because you're checking balance, not testing hypotheses. However, showing corrected p-values demonstrates statistical rigor.
:::

### Missing Data

**Handling Missing Values:**

- ☑ **Show missing counts**: Display N missing for each variable
- ☑ **Include missing %**: Show percentage missing
- ☐ **Exclude missing cases**: Leave unchecked for transparency

**Missing Data Reporting:**

ClinicoPath will show:
```
Age: N = 198 (2 missing)
Sex: N = 200 (0 missing)
BMI: N = 185 (15 missing, 7.5%)
```

## Step 4: Interpret the Results

```

### What the Results Tell You

✅ **Excellent Balance:** All p-values > 0.05
✅ **Small Effect Sizes:** All d and V < 0.15 (negligible)
✅ **Successful Randomization:** Groups are comparable at baseline
✅ **Low Missing Data:** < 10% for all variables

::: {.callout-important}
## Interpreting p-values in Table One
**p > 0.05** is GOOD in baseline characteristics tables! It means groups are well-balanced. Large p-values (0.7-0.9) are ideal.

**p < 0.05** would suggest imbalance, which could indicate:
- Random chance (5% expected)
- Stratification issues
- Selection bias
:::

## Step 5: Add Effect Sizes

Effect sizes show **magnitude** of differences:

| Effect Size | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Cohen's d** (continuous) | |
| 0.0 - 0.2 | Negligible |
| 0.2 - 0.5 | Small |
| 0.5 - 0.8 | Medium |
| > 0.8 | Large |
| **Cramér's V** (categorical) | |
| 0.0 - 0.1 | Negligible |
| 0.1 - 0.3 | Small |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Medium |
| > 0.5 | Large |

**In our example:**
- Age: d = 0.04 (negligible difference)
- Sex: V = 0.03 (negligible difference)
- All effect sizes are negligible → **perfect balance**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Reporting Effect Sizes
Modern journals increasingly require effect sizes. Including them in Table One demonstrates statistical sophistication and transparency.

# Advanced Features {#sec-advanced}

## Stratified Analysis

Sometimes you need to check balance within **subgroups** (e.g., by center in multicenter trials):

### Example: Balance by Study Site

1. In **Cross Tables**, add **Study_Site** to **Layers** box
2. This creates separate tables for each site
3. Check that randomization worked at each center

**Why this matters:**
- Detects center-specific randomization failures
- Required for multicenter trials
- Helps identify site effects

## Handling Outliers

**Problem:** Extreme values can skew means and distort comparisons.

**Solution:** Report median (IQR) instead of mean (SD) for skewed data.

### Detect Skewness

Use **Summary of Continuous Variables**:

1. **Analyses** → **ExplorationT1** → **Summary of Continuous Variables**
2. Select your continuous variables
3. Check **Skewness** and **Kurtosis**

**Rules of Thumb:**
- |Skewness| < 1.0: Normal-ish → Use mean (SD)
- |Skewness| > 1.0: Skewed → Use median (IQR)

**In Cross Tables:**

- ☑ **Use median (IQR) for skewed variables**
- ClinicoPath will automatically switch to Mann-Whitney U test

## Missing Data Patterns

**Problem:** Missing data is not random and could bias results.

**Solution:** Compare missing data patterns between groups.

### Missing Data Analysis

1. Check **Show missing data patterns** in Cross Tables
2. ClinicoPath will test if missingness differs by group

**Example:**
```
Variable         Control Missing   Experimental Missing   p-value
Age              1 (1%)            1 (1%)                 1.00
BMI              8 (8%)            7 (7%)                 0.82
Tumor Size       2 (2%)            3 (3%)                 0.68
```

**Interpretation:**
- p > 0.05: Missing data is balanced (good!)
- p < 0.05: Differential missingness (investigate why)

# Manuscript Reporting {#sec-reporting}

## Methods Section

**Template:**

> Baseline characteristics were summarized as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Comparisons between treatment groups used independent t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact test when expected cell counts were <5) for categorical variables. Effect sizes (Cohen's d for continuous, Cramér's V for categorical) were calculated to assess magnitude of differences. Missing data were handled using available case analysis, with missing counts reported for each variable. All tests were two-sided with α = 0.05. Analyses were conducted using ClinicoPath v0.0.32 for jamovi (jamovi project, 2025).

## Results Section

**Template:**

> Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between treatment groups (Table 1). Mean age was 56.2 years (SD 10.3) in the control group and 55.8 years (SD 9.8) in the experimental group (p = 0.76, d = 0.04). Sex distribution was similar (61% female in control vs. 59% in experimental, p = 0.85). Tumor stage, grade, and size showed no significant differences between groups (all p > 0.38). Effect sizes for all comparisons were negligible (all d < 0.15, V < 0.07), indicating successful randomization. Missing data were minimal (<10% for all variables) and balanced between groups (all p > 0.68).

::: {.callout-note}
## What to Report
- Sample sizes (total and by group)
- Summary statistics for key variables
- P-values for comparisons
- Effect sizes
- Missing data handling
- Statistical test names (can be in Methods or Table footnote)
:::

## Table Footnote

Add this footnote to Table 1:

> Data presented as mean (SD) for continuous variables and n (%) for categorical variables. P-values from independent t-test (continuous normally distributed variables), Mann-Whitney U test (continuous non-normally distributed variables), chi-square test (categorical variables), or Fisher's exact test (categorical variables with expected count <5). Effect size: d = Cohen's d (continuous), V = Cramér's V (categorical). Missing values excluded pairwise; missing counts shown when >0.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid {#sec-mistakes}

## ❌ Mistake 1: Testing for Significance in RCTs

**Wrong Approach:**
> "Age was significantly different between groups (p = 0.03), so we included it as a covariate in our models."

**Why Wrong:**
- Baseline differences in RCTs are due to chance
- p < 0.05 expected in 5% of comparisons by random chance
- Adding covariates based on p-values is data-dredging

**Correct Approach:**
> "Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1). All effect sizes were small (d < 0.3), indicating successful randomization."

## ❌ Mistake 2: Ignoring Effect Sizes

**Wrong Approach:**
> "No significant differences in baseline characteristics (all p > 0.05)."

**Why Incomplete:**
- Large, clinically meaningful differences can have p > 0.05 with small samples
- p-values depend on sample size, effect sizes don't

**Correct Approach:**
> "Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups, with small effect sizes (all d < 0.2, V < 0.1) and non-significant p-values (all p > 0.20)."

## ❌ Mistake 3: Listwise Deletion

**Wrong Approach:**
- Check "Exclude missing values" → Lose 30% of sample

**Why Wrong:**
- Reduces statistical power
- Can introduce bias if missingness is related to outcome

**Correct Approach:**
- Use available case analysis (default in Cross Tables)
- Report missing counts
- Check if missingness differs by group
- Consider multiple imputation for primary analyses

## ❌ Mistake 4: P-Hacking

**Wrong Approach:**
- Run 20 baseline comparisons
- Only report the 2 with p < 0.05
- Don't mention the other 18

**Why Wrong:**
- This is scientific misconduct
- Inflates false positive rate
- Undermines reproducibility

**Correct Approach:**
- Report ALL planned baseline comparisons
- Use multiple testing correction if desired (though not required for Table One)
- Pre-specify which variables go in Table One (in protocol)
