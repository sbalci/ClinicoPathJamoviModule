Clinical utility of the recurrence prediction model was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA), which quantifies net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities. Net benefit represents the difference between the proportion of true positives and false positives, weighted by the relative harm of false positives vs. false negatives. We compared the model to two default strategies: treat all patients (assume all will recur) and treat none (assume no recurrences). The model was considered clinically useful if its decision curve was above both reference strategies within a clinically reasonable threshold range (5-30%). Net interventions avoided quantified the reduction in unnecessary treatments compared to treating all patients. Threshold probabilities reflect the minimum predicted risk at which a patient and clinician would opt for adjuvant chemotherapy, accounting for treatment toxicity. Confidence intervals were estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Analyses used ClinicoPath v0.0.32 for jamovi.",

Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the recurrence prediction model provides net benefit compared to default strategies of treating all or no patients across threshold probabilities of 3-28% (Figure 1). At a threshold of 15% (reflecting current treatment decision-making), the model achieved net benefit of 0.158, compared to 0.082 for treating all patients (difference: 0.076, 95% CI: 0.052-0.101). This translates to 25 unnecessary treatments avoided per 100 patients (95% CI: 18-32) while maintaining recurrence prevention. The full model (including biomarkers) outperformed the clinical-only model (net benefit 0.142, difference 0.016, p = 0.03), justifying biomarker costs through reduced overtreatment.

Cox proportional hazards regression modeled associations between covariates and survival, reporting hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariable models included treatment, age, stage, and grade. Proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals (all p &gt; 0.27).

Five-year survival was 52.8% (95% CI: 42.9-62.7%) vs. 35.2% (95% CI: 25.8-44.6%), respectively.\nIn univariate Cox models, targeted therapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.84, p = 0.004), older age (HR 1.03 per year, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p = 0.002), advanced stage (Stage IV vs. I: HR 8.67, 95% CI: 3.95-19.0, p &lt; 0.001), and higher grade (Grade 3 vs. 1: HR 3.24, 95% CI: 1.68-6.25, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with survival.\nIn multivariable analysis adjusting for age, stage, and grade, targeted therapy remained independently associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42-0.91, p = 0.014). Stage was the strongest predictor (Stage IV vs. I: adjusted HR 6.24, 95% CI: 2.73-14.3, p &lt; 0.001). The final model showed good discrimination (C-index 0.74).",

ClinicoPath created a summary table showing: - Age: Mean and standard deviation - Sex: Counts and percentages - Tumor characteristics\n[PAUSE - SCROLL THROUGH RESULTS]\nThis is the default table style. Let’s make it publication-ready. In the Table Style dropdown, change from ‘tableone’ to ‘gtsummary’. This gives us a modern, clean format.\n[PAUSE]\nMuch better! Now check these optional boxes: - Show Summary: Displays sample size and missing data - Show About: Explains what Table One is - Show Report Sentence: Gives you a copy-ready Methods sentence\n[PAUSE - SCROLL THROUGH NEW OUTPUTS]\nLook at the blue summary box. It tells us: - Original dataset: 200 cases - Complete cases: 97.5% - Missing data: Only 2.5% (very good!) - Variable types: Mix of numeric and categorical\n[PAUSE]\nThe table shows each variable with appropriate statistics: - Continuous variables: Median with interquartile range - Categorical variables: Count with percentage\n[PAUSE]\nScroll down to see the copy-ready report sentence.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis evaluated the diagnostic performance of the digital HER2 score using the gold standard IHC+FISH result as reference. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using the DeLong method. Optimal cutpoint was determined by maximizing Youden index (J = sensitivity + specificity - 1). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at the optimal cutpoint, assuming prevalence equal to the study sample (50%). Comparison between digital and visual scoring used DeLong test for correlated ROC curves. Likelihood ratios quantified diagnostic value. Grey zone analysis identified score ranges with uncertain classification. All tests were two-sided with α = 0.05. Analyses used ClinicoPath v0.0.32 for jamovi.",

At optimal cutpoint 52, sensitivity was 84% and specificity 81%, suitable for our screening scenario.”",
