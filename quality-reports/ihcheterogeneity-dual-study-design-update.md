# IHC Heterogeneity Analysis: Dual Study Design Implementation

## 🎯 **UPDATE SUMMARY**

Successfully enhanced the `ihcheterogeneity` function to support **two different study design types** for IHC heterogeneity analysis, making it more flexible for various research scenarios.

---

## 📊 **SUPPORTED STUDY DESIGNS**

### **1. Reference-Based Studies**
**Use Case**: Compare regional measurements against a reference value
- **Reference**: Overall/whole slide measurement, hotspot value, or central tumor area
- **Regions**: Multiple tissue regions compared to the reference
- **Analysis**: Reference-to-region correlations, bias assessment, representativeness
- **Clinical Example**: "How well do tumor periphery measurements represent overall Ki67?"

### **2. Inter-Regional Studies**
**Use Case**: Compare regional measurements among themselves
- **No Reference**: Analysis without a reference/overall measurement
- **Regions**: At least 2 regional measurements compared among themselves
- **Analysis**: Inter-regional correlations, consistency assessment, variability patterns
- **Clinical Example**: "How consistent are Ki67 measurements across different tumor regions?"

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **UI Changes**
```yaml
# Variable labels updated
- "Overall / Whole Slide / HotSpot (Optional)" # Now optional
- "Regional Measurement 1" (Required)
- "Regional Measurement 2-4" (Optional)
- "Additional Regional Measurements"
```

### **Validation Logic Enhanced**
```r
# Flexible validation based on study design
if (regional_count < 2) {
    # Error: Need at least 2 regional measurements
}

# Study design auto-detection
study_design <- if (has_reference) "reference_based" else "inter_regional"
```

### **Analysis Method Adaptations**

**Reference-Based Analysis:**
```r
if (has_reference) {
    # Correlations between reference and each region
    combined_data <- cbind(whole_section, biopsy_data)
    correlations <- all_correlations[1, -1]  # Reference vs regions

    # ICC includes reference in calculation
    icc_data <- cbind(whole_section, biopsy_data)
}
```

**Inter-Regional Analysis:**
```r
else {
    # Pairwise correlations between all regions
    cor_matrix <- cor(biopsy_data, method = "spearman")
    correlations <- cor_matrix[upper_tri_indices]  # All region pairs

    # ICC calculated only on regional measurements
    icc_data <- biopsy_data
}
```

## 📋 **UPDATED FEATURES**

### **Explanatory Text Enhanced**
- **Study Design Options**: Clearly explains both reference-based and inter-regional studies
- **Data Requirements**: Reference measurement now explicitly optional
- **Flexible Framework**: Adapts analysis description to study type

### **Statistical Analysis Adapted**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Reference-to-region OR inter-regional depending on design
- **ICC Calculation**: Includes reference when available, inter-regional only when not
- **Bias Assessment**: Only performed when reference is available
- **Variability Metrics**: CV and variance calculations work for both designs

### **Error Handling Improved**
- **Design-Specific Validation**: Different error messages for each study type
- **Minimum Requirements**: At least 2 regional measurements (reference optional)
- **Data Quality Checks**: Adapted for both study designs

## 🏥 **CLINICAL USE CASES**

### **Reference-Based Study Examples**

**Scenario 1: Hotspot vs Regional Analysis**
- Reference: Ki67% from hotspot area (high proliferation zone)
- Regions: Ki67% from 4 different tumor regions
- Question: "How representative is hotspot Ki67 of overall tumor?"

**Scenario 2: Whole Slide vs Sampling**
- Reference: ER H-score from whole slide analysis
- Regions: ER H-scores from 3 tissue cores
- Question: "Do tissue cores accurately reflect whole slide ER status?"

### **Inter-Regional Study Examples**

**Scenario 3: Regional Heterogeneity Assessment**
- No Reference: Just regional measurements
- Regions: Ki67% from tumor center, periphery, invasive front, metastatic focus
- Question: "How consistent is Ki67 expression across tumor regions?"

**Scenario 4: Multi-Site Comparison**
- No Reference: Just site-specific measurements
- Regions: PD-L1 expression from primary tumor, lymph node, liver metastasis
- Question: "How variable is PD-L1 expression across metastatic sites?"

## 🎯 **STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION**

### **Reference-Based Results**
- **High ICC (>0.8)**: Regional measurements highly representative of reference
- **Moderate ICC (0.6-0.8)**: Some regional variation but generally consistent
- **Low ICC (<0.6)**: Significant heterogeneity, single region may not represent reference

### **Inter-Regional Results**
- **High ICC (>0.8)**: Consistent expression across all regions
- **Moderate ICC (0.6-0.8)**: Some regional differences but overall coherent pattern
- **Low ICC (<0.6)**: High heterogeneity, regions show distinct expression patterns

## ✅ **VALIDATION RESULTS**

### **Technical Validation**
- ✅ **jmvtools::prepare()**: Passes without errors
- ✅ **Both Study Designs**: Logic correctly handles optional reference
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Appropriate messages for each design type
