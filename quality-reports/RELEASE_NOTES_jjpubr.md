## Critical Fix Applied

### Issue: Omnibus Effect Size Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: The statistics table schema defined an `effectSize` column, but the omnibus test row insertion was missing this required field, causing runtime errors for multi-group comparisons.

**Solution Implemented** (R/jjpubr.b.R, lines 920-945):

#### Eta-Squared for ANOVA Omnibus Tests

```r
# Eta-squared for ANOVA: SS_between / SS_total
formula_str <- paste(private$.escapeVarName(y_col), "~", private$.escapeVarName(x_col))
anova_result <- aov(as.formula(formula_str), data = complete_data)
summary_result <- summary(anova_result)
ss_between <- summary_result[[1]]$`Sum Sq`[1]
ss_total <- sum(summary_result[[1]]$`Sum Sq`)
eta_sq <- ss_between / ss_total
effect_interp <- if (eta_sq < 0.01) "negligible"
                else if (eta_sq < 0.06) "small"
                else if (eta_sq < 0.14) "medium"
                else "large"
paste0("η²=", round(eta_sq, 3), " (", effect_interp, ")")
```

#### Epsilon-Squared for Kruskal-Wallis Omnibus Tests

```r
# Epsilon-squared for Kruskal-Wallis: (H - k + 1) / (n - k)
H <- omnibus_result$statistic
n <- nrow(complete_data)
k <- length(groups)
epsilon_sq <- (H - k + 1) / (n - k)
effect_interp <- if (epsilon_sq < 0.01) "negligible"
                else if (epsilon_sq < 0.06) "small"
                else if (epsilon_sq < 0.14) "medium"
                else "large"
paste0("ε²=", round(epsilon_sq, 3), " (", effect_interp, ")")
```

#### Updated Row Insertion

```r
self$results$statistics$addRow(rowKey = "omnibus", values = list(
    comparison = omnibus_comparison,
    method = omnibus_result$method,
    statistic = omnibus_result$statistic,
    pvalue = omnibus_result$p.value,
    effectSize = omnibus_effect_size,  # ✅ NOW INCLUDED
    significance = if (omnibus_result$p.value < 0.001) "***"
                  else if (omnibus_result$p.value < 0.01) "**"
                  else if (omnibus_result$p.value < 0.05) "*"
                  else "ns"
))
```

**Impact**: Function now correctly reports effect sizes for ALL statistical tests (omnibus + pairwise), preventing runtime errors and providing complete statistical information.

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Natural-Language Summary Output ✅

**Location**: R/jjpubr.b.R, lines 1054-1137

**Feature**: Comprehensive HTML summary that translates statistical results into clinician-friendly language.

**Components**:

- **Omnibus Test Description**: Explains the overall test performed (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis)
- **Pairwise Comparison Summary**: Reports count of significant comparisons with Bonferroni correction context
- **Effect Size Interpretation**: Highlights the largest effect with interpretation (negligible/small/medium/large)
- **Clinical Guidance**: Reminds users to interpret results in clinical context and consider sample size/practical significance

**Example Output**:

```html
📊 Analysis Summary
A one-way ANOVA comparing 3 groups was performed as the omnibus test.
2 of 3 pairwise comparisons were significant after Bonferroni correction.
The largest effect size was large (d = 1.42) between Group A vs Group C.
These results suggest statistically significant differences exist between groups.
Interpret these results in context of clinical importance and sample characteristics.
```

### 2. Complete Effect Size Reporting ✅

**Location**: R/jjpubr.b.R, lines 981-1026 (pairwise), lines 920-945 (omnibus)

#### Pairwise Comparisons

- **Cohen's d** for t-tests (parametric)
  - Formula: (mean₁ - mean₂) / pooled_sd
  - Interpretation: <0.2 (negligible), 0.2-0.5 (small), 0.5-0.8 (medium), >=0.8 (large)
- **Rank-biserial r** for Wilcoxon tests (non-parametric)
  - Formula: 1 - (2U) / (n₁ × n₂)
  - Interpretation: <0.1 (negligible), 0.1-0.3 (small), 0.3-0.5 (medium), >=0.5 (large)

#### Omnibus Tests (NEW)

- **Eta-squared (η²)** for ANOVA
  - Formula: SS_between / SS_total
  - Interpretation: <0.01 (negligible), 0.01-0.06 (small), 0.06-0.14 (medium), >=0.14 (large)
- **Epsilon-squared (ε²)** for Kruskal-Wallis
  - Formula: (H - k + 1) / (n - k)
  - Interpretation: Same thresholds as η²

**Benefit**: Users now receive both p-values (statistical significance) AND effect sizes (practical significance) for ALL tests.

### 3. Kendall Correlation Notice ✅

**Location**: R/jjpubr.b.R, lines 698-711

**Feature**: INFO notice informing users that Kendall's tau correlation does not provide confidence intervals in R's implementation.

**Guidance Provided**:

- Explains technical limitation
- Suggests Spearman correlation as alternative if CIs are needed
- Maintains Kendall as valid option for monotonic relationships with outliers

### 4. Marginal Plots ✅

**Location**: R/jjpubr.b.R, lines 310-323 (already implemented)

**Verification**: Feature already properly implemented using `ggExtra::ggMarginal()` with histogram marginals on scatter plot axes.

## Mathematical & Statistical Correctness

### ✅ Hierarchical Testing Framework

**Implementation**: Lines 893-998

- ✅ Omnibus test performed FIRST for >2 groups
- ✅ Pairwise comparisons ONLY if omnibus p < 0.05
- ✅ INFO notice displayed if omnibus non-significant
- ✅ Bonferroni correction applied to all pairwise tests

**Validation**: Follows proper Type I error control procedures recommended by:

- Maxwell & Delaney (2004) *Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data*
- Hsu (1996) *Multiple Comparisons: Theory and Methods*

### ✅ Assumption Checking

**Implementation**: Lines 765-816

- ✅ Shapiro-Wilk test for normality (per group, n < 5000)
- ✅ Levene's test for homogeneity of variance
- ✅ Automatic switching from parametric to non-parametric when assumptions violated
- ✅ Clear reporting of assumption violations

**Validation**: Standard practice in applied statistics (Field et al., 2012)

### ✅ Effect Size Calculations

#### Pairwise Effect Sizes

**Cohen's d** (Parametric):

- ✅ Uses pooled standard deviation: sqrt([(n₁-1)sd₁² + (n₂-1)sd₂²] / [n₁+n₂-2])
- ✅ Appropriate for equal or unequal sample sizes
- ✅ Interpretation follows Cohen (1988) guidelines

**Rank-biserial r** (Non-parametric):

- ✅ Formula: 1 - 2U/(n₁n₂) where U is Mann-Whitney U statistic
- ✅ Bounded between -1 and +1
- ✅ Interpretation follows Kerby (2014) guidelines

#### Omnibus Effect Sizes

**Eta-squared (η²)** for ANOVA:

- ✅ Formula: SS_between / SS_total
- ✅ Represents proportion of total variance explained by group membership
- ✅ Interpretation follows Cohen (1988): 0.01 (small), 0.06 (medium), 0.14 (large)

**Epsilon-squared (ε²)** for Kruskal-Wallis:

- ✅ Formula: (H - k + 1) / (n - k)
- ✅ Non-parametric analog of eta-squared
- ✅ Less biased than eta-squared for non-normal data
- ✅ Reference: Tomczak & Tomczak (2014) *Journal of Affective Disorders*
