Pearson Correlation: -0.852724395680679 (very strong negative correlation (**) - This suggests a clinically meaningful relationship.)
R-squared (Effect Size): 0.72713889498898 (72.7% of variance explained. Large effect size - clinically meaningful association.)
Regression Slope: -0.0437134502923977 (Negative trend: Each unit increase in X corresponds to 0.0437134502923977 unit decrease in Y on average.)
Copy-Ready Summary:  (Analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between the variables (r = -0.853, p < 0.01). The correlation explains 72.7% of the variance. This relationship is statistically significant. This finding may have clinical relevance.)
Spearman Correlation (Rank-based): -0.886243433815812 (very strong negative correlation (**) - This suggests a clinically meaningful relationship. This non-parametric measure is robust to outliers.)
