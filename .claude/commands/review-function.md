# Detailed Jamovi Function Code Review

You are conducting a thorough code review of the jamovi function `$ARGUMENTS`. Focus on code quality, best practices, performance, and maintainability.

## Review Target

Function: **`$ARGUMENTS`**

## Code Review Focus Areas

### Architecture & Design

- R6 class structure and inheritance
- Function modularization and separation of concerns
- Data flow and state management
- Error propagation and handling

### Implementation Quality

- Algorithm efficiency and performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Code readability and maintainability
- Following jamovi and R best practices

### Robustness & Security

- Input validation completeness
- Edge case handling
- Error message quality and helpfulness
- Data sanitization

### Documentation & UX

**Visibility rule:** Natural‑language summaries and educational/explanatory outputs must render **only when** the corresponding UI options are enabled by the user (see the `.u.yaml` checkboxes below). Keep these sections hidden by default unless selected.

- Code comments and self-documentation
- User interface clarity
- Help text and explanatory content
- Accessibility considerations
- Natural‑language summary of results (plain, copy‑ready).
- Explanatory output panel: what the function does, when/how to use it, assumptions/caveats, and a short user guide.

### Performance & Scalability

- Computational complexity
- Memory efficiency
- Large dataset handling
- Optimization opportunities

### Clinician‑Friendly (Pathologist/Oncologist) Additions

- Plain‑language labels and tooltips for each option (avoid jargon; show examples: e.g., “Select tumor grade (G1/G2/G3)”).
- In‑app micro‑explanations for statistics (what the test answers clinically, assumptions, effect size meaning, minimal sample heuristics).
- Glossary panel (AUC, OR, HR, RMST, FDR, ICC, kappa, DeLong, Fine–Gray, etc.) with 1–2 line clinical interpretations.
- Guided mode (wizard): “Pick your outcome → choose groups → check assumptions → run → interpret outputs.”
- Contextual warnings for misuse (e.g., “Paired test selected but groups are independent”).
- Example interpretations beneath each key result (e.g., “An OR of 2.1 means the odds are ~2× higher in group A”).
- One‑click report sentences (auto‑generated paragraphs with placeholders filled from results; copy to clipboard).
- Defaults tuned to common clinical scenarios; show ‘Recommended’ badges.
- Accessibility & readability: larger font option, color‑blind‑safe palettes, avoid red‑green only.
- Internationalization hooks (TR/EN) for labels, help, and report templates.

## Review Response Format

### CODE REVIEW: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Overall Quality**: 1–5 (stars)  

**Maintainability**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

**User Experience**: EXCELLENT/GOOD/NEEDS_WORK  

#### STRENGTHS

1. [Specific positive findings with code references]
2. [Well-implemented patterns]
3. [Good practices observed]

#### CRITICAL ISSUES

1. [Security/reliability concerns with file:line references]
2. [Performance bottlenecks]
3. [Major design flaws]

2. [Refactoring suggestions]
3. [Performance optimizations]

#### ENHANCEMENT SUGGESTIONS

1. [Feature improvements]
2. [User experience enhancements]
3. [Future-proofing recommendations]

#### **Clinician‑Friendly Improvements:**

- Provide **Example interpretation** blocks under tables/plots.
- Add **guided mode** that enforces a recommended sequence (variables → assumptions → run → interpret).
- Include **copy‑ready report sentences** with placeholders auto‑filled from results.
- Add **misuse detection** (e.g., warn if expected counts < 5 for chi‑square; suggest Fisher’s exact).
- Offer **clinical presets** (e.g., “2×2 diagnostic test,” “KM survival with median & 95% CI,” “ROC with DeLong CI”).
- Provide **TR/EN translations** and ensure medical terminology is consistent.
- Use **color‑blind‑safe** default palettes and increase table readability (thousands separators, units).

**Natural‑language summaries & Explanatory Outputs:**

- Add a top‑level **Summary** box with a plain‑language paragraph that names the test/model, the comparison, key effect (with CI) and p‑value, and one clinical interpretation sentence.
- Add an **About this analysis** panel that briefly explains what the function does, when to use it, inputs required, and typical outputs (with links to docs).
- Add a **Caveats & assumptions** panel that lists assumptions, data requirements (e.g., expected counts, proportional hazards), and common pitfalls; surface contextual warnings if violated.
- Provide a **How to use** checklist (variables → options → run → interpret), and, if possible, a mini example with mock numbers.

#### SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

**Architecture:**

```r
# Suggested refactoring
```

#### ACTION ITEMS

- [ ] [Specific actionable item]
- [ ] [Another specific item]
- [ ] Add plain‑language tooltips.
