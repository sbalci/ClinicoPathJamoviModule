#### üéØ **New Module: Precision-Recall Analysis for Imbalanced Datasets**

* **PR-AUC Calculation**: Area under precision-recall curve (Average Precision)
* **Superior to ROC for Imbalanced Data**: When negative class vastly outnumbers positive class
* **Optimal Threshold Selection**:
  - F1-Score (balanced precision-recall)
  - F2-Score (emphasizes recall/sensitivity)
  - F0.5-Score (emphasizes precision)
  - Custom F-beta scores
* **Baseline Comparison**: Compares to random classifier (baseline = prevalence)
* **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Percentile and BCa methods
* **ROC vs PR Comparison**: Demonstrates when PR analysis is superior
* **Clinical Applications**:
  - Rare event detection: mitotic figures (<1% prevalence), micrometastases
  - Cancer screening with low prevalence
  - Digital pathology quality control where defects are uncommon
  - AI triage systems where abnormal cases are infrequent
  - Biomarker discovery in rare tumor subtypes
* **Key Features**:
  - Performance at key thresholds (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)
  - Confusion matrix at optimal operating points
  - PPV interpretation for clinical decision-making
  - Precision-recall curve visualization
  - F-score optimization across all thresholds
* **Location:** `jamovi > meddecide > ROC Analysis > Precision-Recall Analysis`

##### **Why PR Analysis Matters:**

When dealing with imbalanced datasets (e.g., 1% cancer prevalence):
- **ROC-AUC can be misleadingly high** (e.g., 0.95) even with poor precision
- **PR-AUC provides realistic assessment** of model performance on minority class
- **Focuses on what matters**: How well do we detect the rare positive cases?
- **Baseline is informative**: Improvement over prevalence shows true value

**Example:** In mitotic figure detection with 0.5% prevalence:
- ROC-AUC might be 0.95 (looks excellent)
- PR-AUC might be 0.15 vs baseline 0.005 (shows room for improvement)
- PR analysis reveals the challenge of rare event detection
