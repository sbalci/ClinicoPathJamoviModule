\description{
Comprehensive analysis for validating TNM staging system improvements using
state-of-the-art  statistical methods. This analysis provides pathologists
with robust tools to evaluate whether  a new staging system provides
superior prognostic discrimination compared to existing systems.
Includes advanced metrics: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI),
Integrated Discrimination  Improvement (IDI), time-dependent ROC analysis,
decision curve analysis, bootstrap validation,  and comprehensive clinical
interpretation guidance.
