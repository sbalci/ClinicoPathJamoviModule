\item{Sensitive_Test}{Factor: High sensitivity test ("Negative", "Positive"), Sens=0.95, Spec=0.70}

\description{
Dataset with 160 patients featuring two tests with complementary
characteristics: one very sensitive (0.95) but less specific (0.70), one
very specific (0.95) but less sensitive (0.70).
}
\details{
Simulated with 28\% prevalence. Demonstrates complementary test characteristics
and value of combining tests with different strengths.
