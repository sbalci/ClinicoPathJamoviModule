\title{Simple Tumor Marker and Cancer Progression Data}
\format{
A data frame with 588 observations and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character. Unique patient identifier (CA_001 to CA_100)}
\item{age}{Numeric. Patient age at baseline (years)}
\item{treatment}{Factor. Treatment group (Standard, Experimental)}
\item{visit_time}{Numeric. Time of tumor marker measurement (months from baseline)}
\item{tumor_marker}{Numeric. Tumor marker level (units/mL)}
\item{survival_time}{Numeric. Time to progression/death or last follow-up (months)}
\item{progression_status}{Numeric. Event indicator (0 = censored, 1 = progression/death)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data for educational purposes
}
\usage{
simple_cancer_data
}
\description{
A simplified longitudinal dataset containing tumor marker measurements and cancer progression
for 100 cancer patients. Ideal for teaching and initial exploration of joint models.
}
\details{
This simplified dataset is perfect for:
\itemize{
\item Learning joint modeling concepts
\item Quick algorithm testing
\item Demonstrating treatment effects
\item Smaller sample size for faster computation
\item Clear biomarker-survival relationship
}

Features:
\itemize{
\item Tumor marker levels generally increase over time
\item Experimental treatment slows marker increase
\item Higher marker levels increase progression hazard
\item 10\% event rate over 24 months follow-up
}
}

# Basic joint modeling analysis

# Marker trajectories by treatment

# Individual trajectories for first 20 patients
