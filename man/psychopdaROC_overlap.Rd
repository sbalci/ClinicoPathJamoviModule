\format{
A data frame with 190 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character: Patient identifier (PT001-PT190)}
\item{diagnosis}{Factor: "Diseased" or "Non_Diseased" (40\%/60\% prevalence)}
\item{test_value}{Numeric: Test values with moderate overlap (mean: 60 vs 55, SD 18)}
}

\usage{
psychopdaROC_overlap
}
\description{
Dataset with 190 patients showing moderate overlap between diseased and
non-diseased groups, representing realistic clinical scenarios with
imperfect discrimination.
}
\details{
Small mean difference (5 units) with substantial overlap between groups.
Represents realistic clinical scenarios where diagnostic tests show
moderate but imperfect discrimination (AUC ~0.60-0.65).
