\description{
Simulated dataset of vessel density measurements using stereology methods
in tissue samples from patients with different diagnoses. This dataset
demonstrates quantitative histopathology using systematic grid-based sampling.
}
\details{
\strong{Study Design:}
\itemize{
\item 50 histological images from 3 diagnostic groups
\item Systematic 10×10 grid overlay (100 points per image)
\item Grid spacing: 10 μm
\item Reference area: 1000×1000 μm (1 mm²)
\item Section thickness: 5 μm (standard histology)
}

\strong{Clinical Context:}
Vessel density is a critical parameter in tumor pathology. Malignant tumors
often show increased angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) to support
rapid growth. Stereology provides unbiased quantification of vessel density
from 2D histological sections without requiring 3D reconstruction.

\strong{Vessel Density by Diagnosis:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Normal tissue}: Low vessel density (Aa ~ 0.05-0.10)
\item \strong{Benign tumors}: Moderate vessel density (Aa ~ 0.15-0.25)
\item \strong{Malignant tumors}: High vessel density (Aa ~ 0.30-0.50) due to angiogenesis
}

\strong{Stereological Parameters:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Area Density (Aa)}
\itemize{
\item Formula: Aa = intersections / total_points
\item Meaning: Fraction of tissue area occupied by vessels
\item Use: Primary measure of vessel density
}
\item \strong{Volume Density (Vv)}
\itemize{
\item Formula: Vv = Aa (for isotropic random sections)
\item Meaning: Fraction of tissue volume occupied by vessels
\item Use: 3D estimate from 2D sections
}
\item \strong{Boundary Density (Ba)}
\itemize{
\item Formula: Ba = (2 × boundary_intersections) / line_length
\item Meaning: Vessel boundary length per unit area
\item Use: Measure of vessel complexity
}
\item \strong{Numerical Density (Na)}
\itemize{
\item Formula: Na = object_count / reference_area
\item Meaning: Number of vessels per unit area
\item Use: Vessel count density
}
\item \strong{Surface Density (Sv)}
\itemize{
\item Formula: Sv = 2 × Ba
\item Meaning: Vessel surface area per unit volume
\item Use: Exchange surface quantification
}
}

# Load data

\strong{Why Stereology is Needed:}
\itemize{
\item Provides unbiased estimates of 3D parameters from 2D sections
\item No need for complex 3D reconstruction
\item Well-established statistical properties
\item Reproducible across laboratories
\item Applicable to any histological structure
}

\strong{Expected Results:}
\itemize{
\item Malignant tumors show significantly higher vessel density (Aa ~ 0.39)
\item Benign tumors have intermediate density (Aa ~ 0.20)
\item Normal tissue has lowest density (Aa ~ 0.07)
\item Statistical tests should show significant differences between groups
}

\strong{Quality Control:}
\itemize{
\item Grid spacing appropriate for vessel size (10 μm)
\item Adequate number of points per image (100 points)
\item Multiple images per diagnosis (16-17 per group)
\item Systematic random sampling approach
}
