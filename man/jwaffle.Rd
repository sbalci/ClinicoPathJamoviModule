jwaffle(
  data,
  counts = NULL,
  groups,
  facet = NULL,
  rows = 5,
  flip = FALSE,
  color_palette = "default",
  show_legend = TRUE,
  mytitle = "",
  legendtitle = "",
  showSummaries = FALSE,
  showExplanations = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{counts}{Optional numeric weight variable if cases have different
weights. Leave empty to count each row equally (recommended for most
clinical data). Only needed if your data is pre-aggregated or weighted.}

\item{groups}{The categorical grouping variable for the waffle squares.
Each category will be displayed as proportional colored squares in a 10x10
grid. Examples: Tumor grade (G1/G2/G3), Treatment outcome
(Complete/Partial/No response), Risk categories (Low/Medium/High).}

\item{facet}{Optional variable to split the waffle chart by another
categorical variable to compare distributions across subgroups (e.g., by
treatment arm, patient cohort, or time period). Creates separate waffle
charts for each level.}

\item{rows}{Number of rows in the waffle chart}

\item{flip}{Whether to flip the orientation of the waffle chart}

\item{color_palette}{Color scheme for the waffle squares}

\item{show_legend}{Whether to display the legend}

\item{mytitle}{Custom title for the plot}

\item{legendtitle}{Custom title for the legend}

\item{showSummaries}{Generate natural language summary of waffle chart
results including proportions, dominant categories, and clinical
interpretation.}

\item{showExplanations}{Show detailed methodology explanations about waffle
charts, when to use them, and how to interpret the results in clinical
contexts.}

\description{
'Creates waffle charts to visualize categorical distributions and
proportions using colored squares. Ideal for showing parts-of-whole
relationships in clinical data such as disease subtypes, treatment
outcomes, or risk category distributions. Each square represents a
proportion of the total sample, making it easy to see relative frequencies
across categories.'
