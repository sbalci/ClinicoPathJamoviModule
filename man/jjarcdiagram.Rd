\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{source}{Starting entity in each relationship. Select the variable
containing the "from" nodes. Clinical Examples: • Gene regulatory networks:
Regulator gene (e.g., TP53, BRCA1) • Patient networks: First patient in
similarity pair (Patient_ID) • Disease co-occurrence: Primary diagnosis
(ICD10 code) • Protein interactions: Upstream protein • Treatment pathways:
Initial intervention}

\item{target}{Ending entity in each relationship. Select the variable
containing the "to" nodes. Clinical Examples: • Gene regulatory networks:
Target gene being regulated (e.g., CDK4, MYC) • Patient networks: Second
patient in similarity pair • Disease co-occurrence: Secondary diagnosis or
comorbidity • Protein interactions: Downstream protein • Treatment
pathways: Next intervention in sequence}

\item{weight}{Optional numeric measure of connection strength or
importance. Clinical Examples: • Gene networks: Correlation coefficient
(0-1), fold-change, or interaction score • Patient networks: Similarity
score (e.g., Jaccard index, cosine similarity) • Disease co-occurrence:
Number of co-occurrences or relative risk • Protein interactions: Binding
affinity (Kd) or confidence score • Treatment pathways: Transition
probability (0-1) Leave empty for unweighted networks (all edges treated
equally).}

\item{group}{Optional grouping variable for color-coding entities.
Examples: Gene families,  patient subtypes, disease categories, or
functional classifications.}

\item{analysisPreset}{Choose a preset configuration optimized for specific
clinical or research scenarios.  Gene networks focus on regulatory
relationships, patient networks on similarity patterns,  pathway networks
on biological processes, and comorbidity networks on disease associations.}

\item{showNodes}{Whether to display node points along the arc baseline.
When enabled, nodes are shown as circles at their sorted positions.}

\item{nodeSize}{Method for determining node sizes. 'Fixed' uses constant
size, 'By Degree' scales nodes proportionally to their connectivity (number
of connections).}

\item{nodeSizeValue}{Size of nodes when using fixed sizing, or base size
multiplier when using degree-based sizing. Range: 0.1 to 10.}

\item{sortNodes}{Order in which nodes are arranged along the baseline.
'None' preserves original order, 'By Name' sorts alphabetically, 'By Group'
clusters by categories, 'By Degree' orders by connectivity.}

\item{sortDecreasing}{When sorting nodes, whether to use descending order.
Only applies when Sort Nodes is not 'None'.}

\item{horizontal}{Layout orientation of the arc diagram. When TRUE, nodes
are arranged horizontally with arcs above. When FALSE, nodes are arranged
vertically with arcs to the side.}

\item{arcWidth}{Method for determining arc line widths. 'Fixed' uses
constant width, 'By Weight' scales arc thickness proportionally to edge
weights.}

\item{arcWidthValue}{Width of arcs when using fixed sizing, or base width
when using weight-based sizing. Range: 0.1 to 5.}

\item{arcTransparency}{Transparency level of arc lines. 0 = fully
transparent (invisible), 1 = fully opaque. Lower values reduce visual
clutter in dense networks.}

\item{directed}{Whether to treat the network as directed (edges have
direction from source to target) or undirected (edges represent
bidirectional relationships).}

\item{aggregateEdges}{✅ RECOMMENDED: Combine multiple edges between the
same nodes by summing weights. Why it matters: • Ensures network density ≤
1.0 (without aggregation, density can exceed 1.0) • Prevents inflated
centrality measures • Provides accurate statistical summaries Example: If
Gene A→Gene B appears 3 times with weights \link{2, 3, 5}, aggregation creates a
single edge with weight 10. When to disable: Only if you specifically need
to preserve parallel edges for specialized analyses.}

\item{weightMode}{How edge weights should be interpreted for centrality
calculations. • STRENGTH mode (default): Higher values = stronger
connections   ✅ Use for: Correlations, interaction scores, similarity
indices   Examples: r=0.8 (strong), binding affinity score=90  • DISTANCE
mode: Higher values = longer paths/weaker connections   ⚠️ Use for: Costs,
physical distances, dissimilarity measures   Examples: Euclidean distance,
cost metrics  Most clinical/biological networks use STRENGTH mode.}

\item{arcColorMode}{How to color arcs when nodes are grouped. 'Source'
colors arcs by source node's group, 'Target' by target node's group,
'Gradient' creates a gradient from source to target colors. Only applies
when Color Nodes by Group is enabled.}

\item{colorByGroup}{When a grouping variable is specified, whether to
color-code nodes by their group membership. Requires a group variable.}

\item{showStats}{Whether to display network statistics including number of
nodes, edges, density, and centrality measures.}

\item{showLegend}{Whether to display a color legend when nodes are colored
by groups. Only appears when grouping variable is specified and color by
group is enabled.}

\item{labelSize}{Size of node labels (text). 0.8 is standard size, values
above 1.0 increase label size, below 1.0 decrease it. Range: 0.1 to 2.0.}

\item{plotTitle}{Optional title to display above the arc diagram. Leave
empty for no title.}

\item{showSummary}{Whether to display a natural-language summary paragraph
suitable for copying into reports or publications. Includes network
overview, key findings, and grouping information.}

\item{showAssumptions}{Whether to display detailed assumptions,
interpretation guidelines, and common pitfalls panel. Includes network
requirements, centrality measure explanations, and important notes for
proper interpretation.}

\item{showGlossary}{Whether to display a glossary panel with definitions of
key network analysis terms (nodes, edges, centrality measures, density).
Useful for users new to network analysis.}
