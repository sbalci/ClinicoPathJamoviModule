\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{source}{Starting point of each relationship or connection. Examples:
Gene A regulating Gene B,  Patient X similar to Patient Y, or Disease A
co-occurring with Disease B.}

\item{target}{Endpoint of each relationship or connection. This represents
what is being regulated,  influenced, or connected to by the source entity.}

\item{weight}{Optional numeric measure of connection strength. Examples:
Correlation coefficient,  interaction score, similarity index, or
co-occurrence frequency. Higher values indicate  stronger relationships.}

\item{group}{Optional grouping variable for color-coding entities.
Examples: Gene families,  patient subtypes, disease categories, or
functional classifications.}

\item{analysisPreset}{Choose a preset configuration optimized for specific
clinical or research scenarios.  Gene networks focus on regulatory
relationships, patient networks on similarity patterns,  pathway networks
on biological processes, and comorbidity networks on disease associations.}

\item{showNodes}{Whether to display node points along the arc baseline.
When enabled, nodes are shown as circles at their sorted positions.}

\item{nodeSize}{Method for determining node sizes. 'Fixed' uses constant
size, 'By Degree' scales nodes proportionally to their connectivity (number
of connections).}

\item{nodeSizeValue}{Size of nodes when using fixed sizing, or base size
multiplier when using degree-based sizing. Range: 0.1 to 10.}

\item{sortNodes}{Order in which nodes are arranged along the baseline.
'None' preserves original order, 'By Name' sorts alphabetically, 'By Group'
clusters by categories, 'By Degree' orders by connectivity.}

\item{sortDecreasing}{When sorting nodes, whether to use descending order.
Only applies when Sort Nodes is not 'None'.}

\item{horizontal}{Layout orientation of the arc diagram. When TRUE, nodes
are arranged horizontally with arcs above. When FALSE, nodes are arranged
vertically with arcs to the side.}

\item{arcWidth}{Method for determining arc line widths. 'Fixed' uses
constant width, 'By Weight' scales arc thickness proportionally to edge
weights.}

\item{arcWidthValue}{Width of arcs when using fixed sizing, or base width
when using weight-based sizing. Range: 0.1 to 5.}

\item{arcTransparency}{Transparency level of arc lines. 0 = fully
transparent (invisible), 1 = fully opaque. Lower values reduce visual
clutter in dense networks.}

\item{directed}{Whether to treat the network as directed (edges have
direction from source to target) or undirected (edges represent
bidirectional relationships).}

\item{colorByGroup}{When a grouping variable is specified, whether to
color-code nodes by their group membership. Requires a group variable.}

\item{showStats}{Whether to display network statistics including number of
nodes, edges, density, and centrality measures.}

\item{showLegend}{Whether to display a color legend when nodes are colored
by groups. Only appears when grouping variable is specified and color by
group is enabled.}

\item{labelSize}{Size of node labels (text). 0.8 is standard size, values
above 1.0 increase label size, below 1.0 decrease it. Range: 0.1 to 2.0.}

\item{plotTitle}{Optional title to display above the arc diagram. Leave
empty for no title.}
