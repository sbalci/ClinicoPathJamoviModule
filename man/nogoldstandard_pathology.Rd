\format{
A data frame with 180 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character: Patient identifier (PT001-PT180)}
\item{Pathologist1}{Factor: First pathologist diagnosis ("Benign", "Malignant"), Sens=0.88, Spec=0.92}
\item{Pathologist2}{Factor: Second pathologist diagnosis ("Benign", "Malignant"), Sens=0.85, Spec=0.90}
\item{Pathologist3}{Factor: Third pathologist diagnosis ("Benign", "Malignant"), Sens=0.82, Spec=0.93}
\item{tumor_site}{Factor: Tumor location (Lung, Breast, Colon, Prostate)}
\item{specimen_quality}{Factor: Specimen quality (Adequate, Limited, Poor)}

\description{
Three-pathologist dataset with 180 patients for assessing diagnostic
agreement without a gold standard. Pathologists have varying sensitivity
(0.88, 0.85, 0.82) and high specificity (0.92, 0.90, 0.93).
}
\details{
Simulated with 25\% malignancy prevalence. Pathologists show realistic
variation in diagnostic accuracy. Ideal for pathology agreement studies
using latent class analysis.
