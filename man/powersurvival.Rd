\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame. Note that power analysis typically
doesn't require actual data - it's used for study planning.}

\item{calc_type}{Select what to calculate. 'Power' calculates statistical
power given sample size and hazard ratio. 'Sample Size' determines required
sample size for desired power and hazard ratio. 'Hazard Ratio' calculates
the minimum detectable effect size given sample size and power.}

\item{study_design}{Select the study design complexity. 'Simple' assumes a
fixed follow-up period for all subjects. 'Complex' allows for accrual
period and variable follow-up times.}

\item{hazard_ratio}{The hazard ratio to detect. Values < 1 indicate
protective effects (treatment better than control); values > 1 indicate
harmful effects (control better than treatment).}

\item{power}{The probability of detecting an effect if one exists (1 minus
the Type II error rate). Conventional values are 0.8 or 0.9.}

\item{alpha}{The Type I error rate (probability of falsely rejecting the
null hypothesis). Conventional value is 0.05.}

\item{sample_size}{The total number of subjects across all groups. For
sample size calculation, this is a starting value for the search algorithm.}

\item{allocation_ratio}{The ratio of control group size to treatment group
size. 1 indicates equal allocation. Values > 1 mean more subjects in the
control group; values < 1 mean more in the treatment group.}

\item{prob_event}{The overall probability of observing the event (e.g.,
death) during the study period. This affects the number of events observed,
which is crucial for power.}

\item{accrual_time}{The period over which participants are recruited, in
years. Only used for complex designs.}

\item{follow_up_time}{The additional follow-up period after accrual ends,
in years. Only used for complex designs.}

\item{median_survival}{The median survival time in the control group, in
years. Used to estimate the baseline hazard rate. Only used for complex
designs.}

\item{loss_followup}{The annual rate of loss to follow-up (attrition). Only
used for complex designs.}

⚠️  DEPRECATED: This function has been merged into
'survivalPowerComprehensive' for better functionality.
}
\details{
Legacy power analysis calculating power, sample size, or minimum detectable
hazard ratio for survival studies.
This helps researchers design adequately powered studies to detect
meaningful differences in survival between groups.

📢 PLEASE USE: 'Comprehensive Survival Power Analysis' instead - it
provides all the same functionality
plus additional methods and improved interface.

This function is maintained for backward compatibility only.
