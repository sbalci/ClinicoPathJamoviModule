\usage{
jjsyndromicplot(
  data,
  vars,
  component = 1,
  cutoff = 0.5,
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE,
  arrowsize = 10,
  textsize = 9,
  repel = TRUE,
  plotlegend = TRUE,
  plotcutoff = TRUE,
  varorder = "absdecreasing",
  colorlow = "steelblue1",
  colormid = "white",
  colorhigh = "firebrick1",
  plotwidth = 600,
  plotheight = 600
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{vars}{Continuous variables to include in Principal Component
Analysis. Select at least 3 numeric variables (e.g., biomarker levels,
clinical measurements, gene expression values). PCA will identify patterns
of correlation among these variables.}

\item{component}{Which principal component to visualize (1 = PC1, 2 = PC2,
etc.). PC1 typically explains the most variance in the data.}

\item{cutoff}{Minimum absolute loading value to display a variable (0 to
1). Variables with |loading| >= cutoff will be shown as arrows. Higher
values show fewer, more important variables. Typical range: 0.3-0.6.}

\item{center}{Center variables to have mean = 0 before PCA. Recommended:
TRUE for most analyses.}

\item{scale}{Scale variables to have standard deviation = 1 before PCA.
Recommended: TRUE when variables have different units or scales.}

\item{arrowsize}{Controls the width of arrows proportional to loading
magnitude. Higher values = thicker arrows. Range: 1-30.}

\item{textsize}{Font size for variable labels and loading values. Range:
4-20.}

\item{repel}{Use ggrepel to prevent overlapping variable labels. Set to
FALSE for fixed label positions.}

\item{plotlegend}{Display the color gradient legend at bottom of plot.}

\item{plotcutoff}{Highlight the cutoff threshold region in the legend.}

\item{varorder}{Order of variables around the circle (starting at 12
o'clock, counterclockwise). 'abs decreasing' places strongest loadings
first.}

\item{colorlow}{Color for negative loadings. Use color names or hex codes
(e.g., "#0000FF").}

\item{colormid}{Midpoint color for zero loading. Usually white or light
gray.}

\item{colorhigh}{Color for positive loadings. Use color names or hex codes
(e.g., "#FF0000").}

\item{plotwidth}{Width of the plot in pixels.}

\item{plotheight}{Height of the plot in pixels.}

\description{
Syndromic plots visualize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) loadings using
a unique triangular design with directional arrows. This visualization
method
was developed by Ferguson et al. (2013) for interpreting complex disease
patterns.
}
\details{
Arrow width and color represent the magnitude and direction of variable
loadings
on the selected principal component. Only variables with loadings above the
specified cutoff threshold are displayed.

The triangle center displays the component label and variance accounted for
(VAF).
