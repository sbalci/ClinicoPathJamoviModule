\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{elapsedtime}{The time-to-event or follow-up duration for each
patient. The sum of these values represents the total person-time follow-up
in the study, which serves as the denominator for calculating event rates
and is fundamental for Kaplan-Meier estimates. Should be numeric and
continuous, measured in consistent units (e.g., months or years).}

\item{tint}{Enable this option if you want to calculate survival time from
dates in your data. This is useful when you have separate columns for
diagnosis date and follow-up date and want to calculate the time elapsed
between them.}

\item{dxdate}{The date of diagnosis or study entry for each patient. Should
be in a consistent date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).}

\item{fudate}{The date of last follow-up or event for each patient. Should
be in a consistent date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).}

\item{outcome}{The outcome or event of interest for each patient. Should be
a factor or numeric variable indicating whether the patient experienced the
event (e.g., death) or censoring (e.g., end of follow-up).}

\item{outcomeLevel}{Select the level of the outcome variable that
represents the event of interest. For example, if the outcome variable is
"death_status" with levels "Alive" and "Dead", select "Dead" as the event
level.}

\item{dod}{Select the level of the outcome variable that represents death
due to disease. This is useful for competing risk analysis when there are
multiple event types.}

\item{dooc}{Select the level of the outcome variable that represents death
due to other causes. This is useful for competing risk analysis when there
are multiple event types.}

\item{awd}{Select the level of the outcome variable that represents being
alive with disease. This is useful for competing risk analysis when there
are multiple event types.}

\item{awod}{Select the level of the outcome variable that represents being
alive without disease. This is useful for competing risk analysis when
there are multiple event types.}

\item{analysistype}{Select the type of survival analysis to perform.
"Overall" analyzes the survival of all patients regardless of event type.
"Cause Specific" analyzes the survival for a specific event type (e.g.,
death due to disease). "Competing Risk" analyzes the survival for multiple
event types simultaneously.}

\item{cutp}{Specify the time points at which to calculate survival
probabilities. Enter a comma-separated list of time points in consistent
units (e.g., months or years). For example, "12, 36, 60" calculates
survival probabilities at 1, 3, and 5 years.}

\item{timetypedata}{select the time type in data (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)}

\item{timetypeoutput}{select the time type in output (default is months)}

\item{uselandmark}{Enables landmark analysis, which addresses immortal time
bias by analyzing survival only for patients who survive to a specified
timepoint (the landmark). Use this when you want to eliminate the effect of
early deaths or when comparing treatments that can only be given to
patients who survive long enough to receive them.}

\item{landmark}{Enables landmark analysis, which addresses immortal time
bias by analyzing survival only for patients who survive to a specified
timepoint (the landmark). Use this when you want to eliminate the effect of
early deaths or when comparing treatments that can only be given to
patients who survive long enough to receive them.}

\item{sc}{Enable this option to generate a Kaplan-Meier survival plot with
confidence intervals. This plot shows the estimated survival probability
over time and is useful for visualizing survival trends in your data.}

\item{kmunicate}{Enable this option to generate a publication-ready
survival plot in the style of KMunicate. This plot shows the estimated
survival probability over time with confidence intervals and is suitable
for publication or presentation.}

\item{ce}{Enable this option to calculate and plot the cumulative number of
events over time. This plot shows the total number of events (e.g., deaths)
that have occurred at each time point and is useful for visualizing event
rates in your data.}

\item{ch}{Enable this option to calculate and plot the cumulative hazard
function over time. This plot shows the cumulative risk of experiencing the
event (e.g., death) at each time point and is useful for visualizing the
risk of the event over time.}

\item{endplot}{The maximum time point to include in the survival plots.
This is the end time for the survival curves and cumulative event/hazard
plots. Enter a positive integer representing the time in consistent units
(e.g., months or years).}

\item{ybegin_plot}{The minimum value for the y-axis in the survival plots.
Enter a number between 0 and 1 to set the lower limit of the y-axis.}

\item{yend_plot}{The maximum value for the y-axis in the survival plots.
Enter a number between 0 and 1 to set the upper limit of the y-axis.}

\item{byplot}{The interval for plotting survival probabilities. Enter a
positive integer representing the time interval in consistent units (e.g.,
months or years).}

\item{multievent}{Enable this option to perform survival analysis for
datasets with multiple event levels. This is useful for competing risk
analysis when there are multiple event types (e.g., death due to disease,
death due to other causes).}

\item{ci95}{Enable this option to display 95\\% confidence intervals on the
survival plots. These intervals show the range of uncertainty around the
estimated survival probabilities and are useful for assessing the precision
of the estimates.}

\item{risktable}{Enable this option to display a table of risk estimates at
each time point. This table shows the estimated survival probability,
cumulative event rate, and cumulative hazard at each time point and is
useful for summarizing the survival characteristics of your data.}

\item{censored}{Enable this option to display censored observations on the
survival plots. Censored observations are patients who have not experienced
the event of interest by the end of follow-up and are indicated by vertical
ticks on the survival curves.}

\item{medianline}{If true, displays a line indicating the median survival
time on the survival plot.}

\item{person_time}{Enable this option to calculate and display person-time
metrics, including total follow-up time and incidence rates. These metrics
help quantify the rate of events per unit of time in your study population.}

\item{time_intervals}{Specify time intervals for stratified person-time
analysis. Enter a  comma-separated list of time points to create intervals.
For example,  "12, 36, 60" will create intervals 0-12, 12-36, 36-60, and
60+.}

\item{rate_multiplier}{Specify the multiplier for incidence rates (e.g.,
100 for rates per 100 person-years, 1000 for rates per 1000 person-years).}

\item{showExplanations}{Display detailed explanations for each analysis
component to help interpret the statistical methods and results.}

\item{showSummaries}{Display natural language summaries alongside tables
and plots. These summaries provide plain-language interpretations of the
statistical results. Turn off to reduce visual clutter when summaries are
not needed.}

\description{
Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group
comparisons. The analysis calculates total person-time follow-up (the sum
of all individual  observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate
survival estimates that account  for varying follow-up durations. Use this
when you want to analyze overall survival  characteristics of your entire
study population - for example, to determine median  survival time or
1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.
