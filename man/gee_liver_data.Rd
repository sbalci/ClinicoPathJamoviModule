\description{
Simulated dataset of liver biopsies from dogs with multiple samples per subject.
This dataset is designed to demonstrate Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)
analysis for correlated/clustered data common in pathology studies.
}
\details{
\strong{Study Design:}
\itemize{
\item 50 dogs with 2-4 liver samples each (unbalanced design)
\item Samples from the same dog are correlated
\item Represents typical veterinary pathology study with multiple biopsies
}

\strong{Clinical Context:}
In veterinary pathology, multiple liver samples are often taken from the same
animal to assess disease distribution and severity. These samples are not
independent, requiring GEE or mixed models for proper statistical analysis.

\strong{Correlation Structure:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Within-dog correlation}: Samples from the same dog share baseline characteristics
\item \strong{Exchangeable structure}: Recommended for this data (samples equally correlated)
\item \strong{AR(1) structure}: Can be used if time_point represents sequential sampling
}

\strong{Example Analyses:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Binary Outcome (Diagnosis):}
\preformatted{
# Predicting diagnosis from fibrosis score and age
geemodel(
  data = gee_liver_data,
  outcome = 'diagnosis',
  predictors = c('fibrosis_score', 'age', 'sample_method'),
  cluster_id = 'dog_id',
  family = 'binomial',
  corstr = 'exchangeable',
  robust_se = TRUE
)
}
\item \strong{Count Outcome (Cell Count):}
\preformatted{
# Modeling inflammatory cell count
geemodel(
  data = gee_liver_data,
  outcome = 'cell_count',
  predictors = c('fibrosis_score', 'breed'),
  cluster_id = 'dog_id',
  family = 'poisson',
  corstr = 'exchangeable',
  robust_se = TRUE
)
}
\item \strong{Continuous Outcome (Fibrosis Score):}
\preformatted{
# Predicting fibrosis from age and sample method
geemodel(
  data = gee_liver_data,
  outcome = 'fibrosis_score',
  predictors = c('age', 'sample_method', 'pathologist_experience'),
  cluster_id = 'dog_id',
  family = 'gaussian',
  corstr = 'exchangeable',
  robust_se = TRUE
)
}
}

\strong{Why GEE is Needed:}
\itemize{
\item Standard regression assumes independent observations
\item Multiple samples per dog violate independence assumption
\item GEE accounts for within-dog correlation
\item Provides valid standard errors and inference
}

\strong{Data Generation:}
Data was simulated with realistic correlations:
\itemize{
\item Dogs with higher age tend to have higher fibrosis scores
\item Samples from the same dog share baseline disease severity
\item Diagnosis probability increases with fibrosis score and age
\item Sample method affects diagnostic accuracy
