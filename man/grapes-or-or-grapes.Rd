\description{
Comprehensive missing data analysis and multiple imputation using mice and ggmice packages.
This function provides a complete workflow for analyzing missing data patterns, performing
multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), and evaluating imputation quality.
Designed specifically for clinical research applications where missing data is common
and proper handling is critical for valid statistical inference.

Comprehensive clinical prediction model builder with advanced validation and performance assessment.
Creates multiple logistic regression models optimized for integration with Decision Curve Analysis.
Provides robust error handling, comprehensive validation, and clinical interpretation guidance.
}
\details{
The missing data analysis function provides three main analysis types:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Pattern Analysis}: Explores missing data structure and patterns
\item \strong{Multiple Imputation}: Performs MICE imputation with convergence diagnostics
\item \strong{Complete Analysis}: Combines pattern analysis and imputation
}

Key features include:
\itemize{
\item Visual and tabular missing data pattern analysis
\item Multiple imputation methods (PMM, Bayesian regression, logistic regression)
\item Convergence diagnostics with trace plots
\item Quality evaluation comparing observed vs imputed data
\item Flexible parameter customization
\item Clinical research focused interpretations
}

Common clinical applications:
\itemize{
\item Data quality assessment for clinical trials
\item Missing data handling in observational studies
\item Regulatory compliance for pharmaceutical research
\item Sensitivity analysis for missing data assumptions
}

The Prediction Model Builder supports multiple modeling approaches:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Basic Clinical Models}: Core demographic and primary risk factors
\item \strong{Enhanced Clinical Models}: Extended clinical variables and interactions
\item \strong{Biomarker Models}: Integration of laboratory values and advanced diagnostics
\item \strong{Custom Models}: User-defined variable combinations
}

Key features include:
\itemize{
\item Automatic data splitting for unbiased validation
\item Advanced missing data handling with multiple imputation
\item Comprehensive performance metrics (AUC, calibration, NRI, IDI)
\item Cross-validation and bootstrap validation
\item Stepwise selection and penalized regression
\item Seamless integration with Decision Curve Analysis
\item Clinical risk score generation
\item Robust error handling and validation
}
