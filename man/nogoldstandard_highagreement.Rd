\title{nogoldstandard High Agreement Data}
\format{
A data frame with 150 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{patient_id}{Character: Patient identifier (PT001-PT150)}
\item{Test1}{Factor: First test ("Negative", "Positive"), Sens=0.90, Spec=0.90}
\item{Test2}{Factor: Second test ("Negative", "Positive"), Sens=0.88, Spec=0.88, 95\% agreement}
\item{age}{Numeric: Patient age in years (mean 60, SD 10)}
}

\usage{
nogoldstandard_highagreement
}
\description{
Dataset with 150 patients where two tests show high agreement (95\%
concordance). Tests have good sensitivity (0.90, 0.88) and specificity
(0.90, 0.88).
}
\details{
Simulated with 35\% prevalence. High correlation between tests (95\% conditional
agreement) tests latent class model assumptions about conditional independence.
