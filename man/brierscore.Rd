\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{time}{Time-to-event or censoring variable. For survival analysis,
this is the follow-up time in days, months, or years.}

\item{event}{Binary event indicator variable (1 = event occurred, 0 =
censored). For competing risks, can be multi-level factor.}

\item{event_code}{Which level of the event variable represents the event of
interest (e.g., death, progression, recurrence).}

\item{predicted_survival}{Pre-computed survival probabilities at the
specified prediction time. Should be between 0 and 1. For example,
predicted 5-year survival probability from a Cox model or machine learning
algorithm.}

\item{linear_predictor}{Linear predictor from Cox model (log hazard ratio).
If provided instead of predicted_survival, survival probabilities will be
computed using Breslow estimator and baseline hazard.}

\item{prediction_formula}{Formula for prediction model if neither
predicted_survival nor linear_predictor is provided. Example: "~ age +
stage + grade". Cox model will be fitted internally and predictions
generated.}

\item{prediction_time}{Time point at which to evaluate Brier score (in same
units as time variable). For example, 60 months for 5-year predictions,
1825 days for 5-year predictions in days.}

\item{multiple_time_points}{Calculate Brier scores at multiple time points
to show how calibration changes over time.}

\item{time_points}{Comma-separated list of additional time points for
evaluation. Example: "12, 24, 36, 60" for 1, 2, 3, and 5 years (in months).}

\item{calculate_ibs}{Calculate Integrated Brier Score by integrating
time-dependent Brier score across follow-up period. Provides single summary
measure of overall prediction performance across time.}

\item{ibs_start_time}{Start time for IBS integration. Usually 0 to include
entire follow-up period.}

\item{ibs_end_time}{End time for IBS integration. Should not exceed maximum
follow-up time. Determines the time horizon over which prediction
performance is summarized.}

\item{scaled_brier}{Calculate scaled (standardized) Brier score relative to
null model (Kaplan-Meier survival curve). Scaled Brier = 1 - (Brier_model /
Brier_null). Values near 0 indicate no improvement over KM, positive values
indicate better predictions than KM.}

\item{reference_model}{Compare Brier score to a reference prediction model
to assess incremental value of new predictors.}

\item{reference_predictions}{Pre-computed survival probabilities from
reference model for comparison.}

\item{reference_formula}{Formula for reference model if
reference_predictions not provided. Example: "~ age + stage" (simpler than
full model).}

\item{confidence_intervals}{Calculate confidence intervals for Brier scores
using bootstrap or influence function methods.}

\item{ci_method}{Method for confidence interval estimation. Bootstrap is
more accurate but computationally intensive, influence function is faster.}

\item{bootstrap_samples}{Number of bootstrap samples for confidence
interval estimation. More samples provide more stable estimates.}

\item{confidence_level}{Confidence level for interval estimation.}

\item{compare_multiple_models}{Compare Brier scores across multiple
prediction models to identify the best calibrated model.}

\item{additional_predictions}{Additional prediction variables (survival
probabilities) from competing models for comparison.}

\item{model_names}{Comma-separated names for prediction models being
compared. Used for labeling output tables and plots.}

\item{competing_risks}{Use competing risks framework when multiple event
types can occur. Brier score accounts for cumulative incidence rather than
survival.}

\item{cause_specific}{For competing risks, calculate cause-specific Brier
score for the event of interest.}

\item{plot_brier_over_time}{Plot time-dependent Brier score across
follow-up period. Shows how prediction accuracy changes over time.}

\item{plot_calibration_curve}{Display calibration curve showing agreement
between predicted and observed survival probabilities. Perfect calibration
appears as 45Â° line.}

\item{calibration_groups}{Number of risk groups for calibration curve
(e.g., deciles = 10). More groups provide finer resolution but require
larger sample size.}

\item{plot_model_comparison}{Bar plot comparing Brier scores across
multiple models with confidence intervals.}

\item{plot_integrated_brier}{Visualize IBS as area under the Brier score
curve over time.}

\item{stratified_brier}{Calculate Brier scores stratified by important
subgroups to assess calibration consistency across populations.}

\item{stratify_by}{Variable for stratified analysis (e.g., treatment arm,
age group, center).}

\item{inverse_probability_weighting}{Use inverse probability of censoring
weighting (IPCW) to handle censored observations. Recommended for proper
Brier score estimation.}

\item{external_validation}{Indicate this is external validation (model
developed on different dataset). Affects interpretation and may trigger
additional diagnostics.}

\item{temporal_validation}{Indicate this is temporal validation (more
recent patients than development cohort). May assess calibration drift over
time.}

\item{development_period}{End date of development period for temporal
validation assessment (format: YYYY-MM-DD).}

\item{missing_handling}{Method for handling missing predictor or outcome
data.}

\item{random_seed}{Random seed for bootstrap sampling and other stochastic
procedures.}

\description{
Brier Score analysis for evaluating calibration accuracy of survival
probability predictions. The Brier score measures the mean squared
difference between predicted survival probabilities and observed outcomes
at specific time points, providing a comprehensive assessment of both
discrimination and calibration. Lower Brier scores indicate better
prediction accuracy (perfect prediction = 0, worst = 1). The Integrated
Brier Score (IBS) extends this by integrating the time-dependent Brier
score across the follow-up period, providing a single summary measure of
overall prediction performance. Includes scaled Brier scores relative to
null model (KM curve) and comparison to reference models. Essential for
validating Cox regression models, machine learning survival predictions,
and risk calculators. Particularly valuable for clinical prediction models
where accurate probability estimates are critical for patient counseling
and treatment decisions. Supports external validation, temporal validation,
and competing risks scenarios.
