\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame (optional for power calculations).}

\item{method_category}{Choose the category of survival analysis method.
Standard methods include log-rank tests and Cox regression. Competing risks
methods analyze multiple event types. Advanced methods include RMST,
non-inferiority, and specialized approaches.}

\item{calculation_type}{Select what parameter to calculate. Most commonly
used are sample size (given desired power) and power (given available
sample size).}

\item{statistical_method}{Choose the specific statistical method. Available
options depend on the selected method category. Schoenfeld method is most
common for log-rank tests.}

\item{study_design}{Simple design assumes fixed follow-up time. Complex
design includes accrual period and variable follow-up. Sequential designs
allow interim analyses.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error rate. Standard values: 0.05 (two-sided) or 0.025
(one-sided). For non-inferiority trials, consider 0.025.}

\item{power}{Statistical power (probability of detecting true effect).
Standard values: 0.80 (80\\%) or 0.90 (90\\%). Higher power requires larger
sample sizes.}

\item{sample_size}{Total number of subjects in the study. Used when
calculating power or detectable effect size from a fixed sample size.}

\item{allocation_ratio}{Ratio of control to treatment group sizes. 1.0 =
equal allocation (1:1), 2.0 = twice as many controls (2:1). Equal
allocation is most efficient.}

\item{hazard_ratio}{Expected hazard ratio. Values < 1 indicate treatment
benefit. Common values: 0.75 (25\\% reduction), 0.67 (33\\% reduction), 0.50
(50\\% reduction).}

\item{median_survival_control}{Expected median survival time in control
group. Units should match your study timeline (months, years, etc.).}

\item{median_survival_treatment}{Expected median survival time in treatment
group. Should be longer than control group for beneficial treatments.}

\item{accrual_period}{Time period for patient recruitment (months/years).
Longer accrual periods allow for smaller sample sizes but extend study
duration.}

\item{follow_up_period}{Additional follow-up time after accrual completion.
Total study duration = accrual period + follow-up period.}

\item{dropout_rate}{Annual rate of loss to follow-up (0.05 = 5\\% per year).
Higher dropout rates require larger sample sizes to maintain power.}

\item{event_rate}{Proportion of subjects expected to experience the event
during study period. Used for simple design calculations.}

\item{competing_event_rate}{Proportion experiencing competing events (for
competing risks analysis). Should be less than primary event rate.}

\item{cumulative_incidence_control}{Expected cumulative incidence of
primary event in control group (for competing risks analysis).}

\item{cumulative_incidence_treatment}{Expected cumulative incidence of
primary event in treatment group (for competing risks analysis).}

\item{rmst_timepoint}{Time point for restricted mean survival time
analysis. Should be clinically meaningful and within study follow-up
period.}

\item{non_inferiority_margin}{Non-inferiority margin for hazard ratio. 1.25
means treatment is non-inferior if HR < 1.25 (25\\% increase in hazard is
acceptable).}

\item{superiority_test}{After establishing non-inferiority, test for
superiority. Requires hierarchical testing approach to control Type I
error.}

\item{snp_maf}{Minor allele frequency for SNP-based survival analysis.
Common range: 0.05-0.45.}

\item{genetic_model}{Genetic inheritance model for SNP analysis. Additive
model is most common.}

\item{number_of_looks}{Number of planned interim analyses for sequential
designs. More looks require larger sample sizes to maintain overall Type I
error.}

\item{spending_function}{Method for spending Type I error across interim
analyses. O'Brien-Fleming type preserves most alpha for final analysis.}

\item{show_detailed_output}{Display detailed calculation steps and
intermediate results.}

\item{show_sensitivity_analysis}{Perform sensitivity analysis varying key
parameters around their specified values (+/- 10\\%, 20\\%).}

\item{show_power_curves}{Generate plots showing power vs sample size,
effect size, or other parameters.}

\item{export_study_design}{Generate a comprehensive study design document
suitable for protocols and grant applications.}

\description{
Comprehensive power analysis and sample size calculation for survival
studies and clinical trials. Unifies all survival power methods: standard
log-rank tests, Cox regression, competing risks, RMST-based analyses,
non-inferiority trials, and specialized methods. Supports both simple and
complex study designs with accrual periods, variable follow-up, and dropout
considerations. Essential for study planning, grant applications, and
regulatory submissions.
