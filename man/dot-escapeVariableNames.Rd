\value{
The function produces an HTML table output, and if requested, an additional
downloadable CSV export.

A comprehensive results object containing survival analysis outputs
}
\description{
This function generates cross tables comparing a dependent variable (rows)
with a grouping variable (columns) and automatically selects hypothesis tests
appropriate for clinical research. The output tables are rendered in various
styles (e.g., arsenal, finalfit, gtsummary, NEJM, Lancet, hmisc) and are intended
for pathologists and oncologists. In addition to visualizing associations,
this function now optionally provides an exportable CSV version of the cross table.

Performs comprehensive univariate and stratified survival analysis comparing survival between groups.
This analysis calculates person-time follow-up for each group and uses this to derive accurate
survival estimates and incidence rates that account for varying follow-up durations across groups.
The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates person-time by modeling the hazard function,
which represents the instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time.

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Kaplan-Meier survival curves with multiple plot types
\item Cox proportional hazards regression (univariate and stratified)
\item Median survival time with confidence intervals
\item Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) analysis
\item Person-time analysis with incidence rates
\item Competing risks and cause-specific survival
\item Landmark analysis for conditional survival
\item Proportional hazards assumption testing
\item Model residual diagnostics
\item Pairwise group comparisons with multiple testing correction
}

\strong{Statistical Methods:}
\itemize{
\item Kaplan-Meier estimator for survival probabilities
\item Log-rank test for group comparisons
\item Cox proportional hazards model for risk assessment
\item Competing risks analysis using cumulative incidence functions
\item RMST for robust survival comparisons
}

\strong{Visualization Options:}
\itemize{
\item Standard survival curves
\item Cumulative events and hazard plots
\item KMunicate-style plots for publication
\item Log-log plots for proportional hazards assessment
\item Residual diagnostic plots
}
}
\details{
The function cleans variable names and applies original labels. It then builds
a formula based on the cleaned data and performs the appropriate statistical
test (e.g. chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact test). Detailed user guidance is provided
via HTML to-do messages.

\strong{Analysis Types:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Overall Survival}: Time from study entry to death from any cause
\item \strong{Cause-Specific Survival}: Time to death from specific cause (censoring other deaths)
\item \strong{Competing Risks}: Accounts for multiple types of events that prevent observation of the primary outcome
}

\strong{Person-Time Analysis:}
Calculates incidence rates accounting for varying follow-up times. Particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Studies with differential loss to follow-up
\item Comparison of event rates across populations
\item Assessment of time-varying risk
}

\strong{Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST):}
Alternative to median survival when survival curves don't reach 50\% or for comparing
survival over a specific time horizon. Represents the area under the survival curve
up to a specified time point.

\strong{Model Diagnostics:}
\itemize{
\item Proportional hazards assumption testing using Schoenfeld residuals
\item Martingale and deviance residuals for outlier detection
\item Log-log plots for visual assessment of proportional hazards
