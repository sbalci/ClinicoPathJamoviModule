\description{
A simulated dataset for demonstrating AI model validation methods.
Contains AI predictions, human expert scores, clinical biomarkers,
and gold-standard diagnosis for 200 patients.
}
\details{
This dataset was generated to demonstrate AI model validation techniques
including cross-validation, calibration assessment, and model comparison.
The AI_score is designed to have good but imperfect discrimination,
making it suitable for demonstrating various validation metrics.

The outcome (diagnosis) was generated based on a logistic model with
AI_score, biomarkers, and age as predictors, plus random noise to
simulate real-world variability.
