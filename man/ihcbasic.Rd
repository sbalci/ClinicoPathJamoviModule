\arguments{
\item{data}{the data as a data frame}

\item{markers}{IHC marker variables (categorical 0-3 or continuous
H-scores)}

\item{id}{Optional case/sample identifier for labeling}

\item{computeHScore}{Generate H-score statistics (mean, median, range) for
each marker. H-scores represent staining intensity multiplied by percentage
of positive cells, providing a comprehensive measure of protein expression
(range 0-300).}

\item{clusterMethod}{Method for clustering samples by IHC expression
patterns. Hierarchical clustering builds tree-like relationships and works
well for small to medium datasets. K-means is faster for large datasets but
assumes spherical clusters. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) is more
robust to outliers.}

\item{nClusters}{Number of distinct IHC expression patterns to identify.
Start with 2-3 patterns for initial exploration. More patterns may reveal
tumor heterogeneity but require larger sample sizes (rule of thumb: at
least 3-5 samples per pattern).}

\item{distanceMetric}{How to measure similarity between samples. Gower
distance works with different IHC scoring scales (0-3, H-scores, binary)
and is recommended for most analyses. Jaccard distance only considers
presence/absence of staining.}

\item{linkageMethod}{How to form groups in hierarchical clustering. Ward's
method creates well-balanced groups and is recommended for most IHC
analyses. Complete linkage creates tight, compact clusters. Average linkage
provides a moderate approach between the two.}

\item{standardizeData}{Recommended when markers use different scales (e.g.,
mixing 0-3 scores with H-scores). Puts all markers on the same scale so no
single marker dominates the analysis. Disable for binary data or when all
markers use the same scale.}

\item{showDendrogram}{Shows the hierarchical relationship between samples
as a tree diagram. Helps visualize how expression patterns relate to each
other and identify the optimal number of groups.}

\item{showHeatmap}{Visual representation of IHC staining patterns across
all samples. Each row represents a patient sample, each column represents a
marker. Colors indicate expression levels, with samples grouped by similar
patterns.}

\item{silhouetteAnalysis}{Recommended: Evaluates how well-separated the
expression patterns are. Higher scores indicate more reliable, clinically
meaningful patterns. Helps determine if the identified patterns are real or
due to noise.}

\item{scoringScale}{The IHC scoring system used in your data. Standard 0-3
scale is most common (0=no staining, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong
staining). Binary scoring records only presence/absence. H-score combines
intensity and percentage of positive cells (range 0-300).}
