\usage{
statsplot2(
  data,
  dep,
  group,
  grvar = NULL,
  direction = "independent",
  distribution = "p",
  alluvsty = "t1",
  excl = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame.}

\item{dep}{The dependent variable (y-axis, 1st measurement). Can be
continuous or categorical.}

\item{group}{The grouping variable (x-axis, 2nd measurement). Can be
continuous or categorical.}

\item{grvar}{Optional grouping variable for creating grouped plots across
multiple panels.}

\item{direction}{Measurement design type. "independent" for
between-subjects comparisons,  "repeated" for within-subjects/repeated
measures comparisons.}

\item{distribution}{Statistical approach: "p" = parametric, "np" =
nonparametric,  "r" = robust, "bf" = Bayes factor.}

\item{alluvsty}{Style for alluvial diagrams: "t1" = ggalluvial with stratum
labels,  "t2" = easyalluvial with automatic variable selection.}

\item{excl}{If TRUE, excludes rows with missing values before analysis.}
}

\description{
Automatically selects and generates the most appropriate statistical
visualization based on variable data types. Features enhanced error
messages with contextual guidance, robust data validation, and
comprehensive fallback options. Supports both independent and repeated
measures designs with various plot types including violin plots, scatter
plots, bar charts, and alluvial diagrams.

\examples{
# Automatic plot selection for factor vs continuous variables
statsplot2(
    data = mtcars,
    dep = "mpg",
    group = "cyl",
    direction = "independent",
    distribution = "p"
)

# Repeated measures with alluvial diagram
statsplot2(
    data = survey_data,
    dep = "condition_baseline",
    group = "condition_followup",
    direction = "repeated",
    alluvsty = "t1"
)

# Enhanced error messages provide contextual guidance:
# - Variable names and types in error messages
# - Specific data requirement feedback
# - Package installation instructions when needed
# - Actionable suggestions for unsupported combinations
