**Full Citation**: Maglalang NA, Fadare O. Pathologic sampling of the omentum for neoplasms that involve the female genital tract: A retrospective analysis of 1055 cases. *Am J Clin Pathol.* 2025. doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaf082

**Institution**: University of California San Diego (UCSD), Department of Pathology
**Study Period**: January 2002 - August 2024 (22+ years)
**Cohort Size**: n=1,055 gynecologic cancer staging omentectomies
**Study Design**: Retrospective pathology report review

---

## Executive Summary

This UCSD study by Maglalang & Fadare (2025) concludes that **1-2 blocks are sufficient** for omentum sampling in gynecologic cancers when the omentum is either grossly normal or multifocally/diffusely abnormal. This represents a radical departure from current international guidelines (ISGyP, RCP, ICCR) recommending 4-10 blocks.

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Retrospective design vulnerability**: 20+ years of heterogeneous practices with no standardization
2. **Sampling bias**: Variable block submission by prosectors at different training levels
3. **Statistical power limitations**: Grouping methodology masks detection sensitivity issues
4. **Clinical impact not assessed**: No survival or understaging outcomes analyzed
5. **False negative rate ignored**: Focus on MPR without addressing missed disease

**Our Response**: The omentum study should provide **prospective validation** with:
- Standardized sectioning protocols
- Complete sampling as gold standard
- False negative rate quantification
- Clinical outcome correlation
- Tissue volume-based adequacy modeling

## Study Design & Methodology

### Cohort Characteristics

**Inclusion Criteria**:
- Omentum resected for gynecologic cancer staging (2002-2024)
- Borderline or malignant neoplasms of ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus
- Epithelial, sarcomas, sex cord stromal tumors, metastases

**Distribution**:
- **n=536 (50.8%)**: Grossly normal omentum
- **n=519 (49.2%)**: Grossly abnormal omentum
  - Focally abnormal: 13.2% (n=140)
  - Multifocally abnormal: 30.0% (n=316)
  - Diffusely abnormal: 6.0% (n=63)

**Primary Sites**:
- Tubo-ovarian/peritoneal: 71.9% (n=759)
- Uterine: 18.0% (n=189)
- Synchronous/metastatic: 10.1% (n=107)

**Histotypes**:
- Serous carcinoma: 43.7% (n=461, includes ovarian + uterine)
- Borderline tumors: 11.1% (n=117)
- Low-grade endometrioid: 8.1% (n=85)
- Carcinosarcoma: 4.0% (n=42)
- Others: 33.1% (n=350)

### Gross Appearance Classification

**4-Category System** (preset guidelines applied retrospectively):

1. **Normal** (n=536):
   - Described as "normal," "unremarkable," "no distinct lesions"
   - Yellow/tan/reddish lobulated cut surfaces

2. **Focally Abnormal** (n=140):
   - Single discrete abnormality ≤10% of specimen
   - Fibrosis, nodule, mass, induration in one location
   - Includes separate "omental nodule" specimens

3. **Multifocally Abnormal** (n=316):
   - Multiple discrete lesions throughout specimen
   - Described as "multiple," "several," "numerous"

4. **Diffusely Abnormal** (n=63):
   - Predominance of lesional over fatty component
   - "Diffuse," "replaced," "entirely involved," "caked"
   - Solid cut surfaces, firm/rubbery consistency

**Note**: This classification was applied retrospectively by study authors, not by original prosectors.

### Sampling Variables Analyzed

**Three frameworks used**:

1. **Number of Blocks Submitted** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, >10)

2. **Block Groups** (arbitrarily defined):
   - 1-2 blocks
   - 3-4 blocks
   - 5-6 blocks
   - >6 blocks

3. **Block to Size Ratio** (approximate deciles):
   - 1% to <10%
   - 10% to <20%
   - 20% to <30%
   - 30% to <40%
   - ≥40%

**Formula**: Block-to-size ratio = (Number of blocks ÷ Widest omental dimension in cm) × 100%

### Outcome Measure

**Microscopic Positivity Rate (MPR)**:
- Definition: Percentage of cases with viable tumor cells on histology
- Positive: Definitive viable tumor cells present
- Negative: Acellular mucin, psammoma bodies, atypical cells, reactive changes (without tumor)

---

## Key Findings

### Grossly Normal Omentum (n=536)

**Overall MPR**: 8.0% (43/536 microscopic disease detected)

**MPR by Number of Blocks**:
- 1 block: 6.7% (10/149)
- 2 blocks: 6.9% (5/72)
- 3 blocks: 9.6% (5/52)
- 4 blocks: 6.7% (1/15)
- 5 blocks: 11.8% (4/34)
- 6 blocks: 7.9% (15/190)
- 7-10 blocks: 0-33.3% (small n)
- >10 blocks: 0% (0/6)

**MPR by Block Groups**:
- 1-2 blocks: 6.8% (15/221)
- 3-4 blocks: 9.0% (6/67)
- 5-6 blocks: 8.5% (19/224)
- >6 blocks: 12.5% (3/24)

**Statistical Analysis**:
- **Pairwise comparisons**: P > .50 for all (NO significant differences)
- **Cochran-Armitage trend test**: P = .88 (NO linear trend)
- **Binomial logistic regression**:
  - Block groups: OR=1.144 (95% CI: 0.794-1.648), P=.47
  - Block-to-size ratio: OR=1.022 (95% CI: 0.770-1.358), P=.88
- **Fisher exact test**: P = .66 (no association between block groups and MPR)

**Block-to-Size Ratio Analysis**:
- 1% to <10%: 8.2% MPR (15/182)
- 10% to <20%: 6.3% MPR (12/190)
- 20% to <30%: 10.3% MPR (8/78)
- 30% to <40%: 6.9% MPR (2/29)
- ≥40%: 10.5% MPR (6/57)
- **P = .72** (no difference), **trend P = .39**

**Authors' Conclusion for Normal Omentum**:
> "Submitting 1 to 2 block sections of the omentum in the studied setting results in an MPR that is not statistically significantly lower than the MPR associated with higher levels of sampling."

---

### Grossly Abnormal Omentum (n=519)

**Overall MPR**: 85.2% (442/519 microscopic disease confirmed)

**MPR by Subgroup**:
- Focally abnormal: 66.4% (93/140)
- Multifocally abnormal: 91.1% (288/316)
- Diffusely abnormal: 96.8% (61/63)
- Multifocal + diffuse: 92.1% (349/379)

**MPR by Block Groups** (all abnormal):
- 1-2 blocks: 88.0% (221/251)
- 3-4 blocks: 87.1% (135/155)
- 5-6 blocks: 81.2% (56/69)
- >6 blocks: 68.2% (30/44)

**Note**: The >6 blocks group had **significantly lower MPR** (P<.05), which authors attribute to sampling bias (prosectors over-sampling equivocally abnormal cases).

**MPR for Multifocal + Diffuse** (most unequivocal):
- 1-2 blocks: 95.5% (168/176)
- 3-4 blocks: 91.5% (108/118)
- 5-6 blocks: 85.45% (47/55)
- >6 blocks: 86.7% (26/30)

**Authors' Conclusion for Abnormal Omentum**:
> "For diffusely or multifocally abnormal cases, the highest MPR (95.5%) was reached at the 1 to 2 blocks group level, and MPR did not statistically significantly increase with higher levels of sampling."

---

### Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Subanalysis

**Special Finding** (grossly normal, tubo-ovarian/peritoneal, n=349):
- **Post-neoadjuvant MPR**: 19.0% (4/21) with 1-2 blocks
- **No neoadjuvant MPR**: 3.8% (4/104) with 1-2 blocks
- **P = .03** (statistically significant)

**Interpretation**: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy causes tumor regression → grossly normal appearance but microscopic residual disease remains.

**MPR by Sampling Level** (post-neoadjuvant only):
- 1-2 blocks: 19.0% (4/21)
- 3-4 blocks: 7.1% (3/42)
- 5-6 blocks: 7.4% (7/94)
- >6 blocks: 11.1% (2/18)

**Statistical significance**: P = .21, .20, .67 (NS for all pairwise comparisons)

**Authors' Caveat**:
> "Small cohort sizes... more extensive sampling of the omentum may be necessary in the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting, at least until the question can be specifically evaluated with larger datasets."

---

### Tumor Type & Primary Site Effects

**Gross Omental Involvement by Primary**:
- Tubo-ovarian/peritoneal: 54.0% (410/759)
- Uterine: 24.3% (46/189)

**MPR for Grossly Abnormal by Primary**:
- Tubo-ovarian/peritoneal: 86.8% (356/410)
- Uterine: 71.7% (33/46)
- **P = .009** (statistically significant)

**Site-Specific Sampling Analysis**:
Authors separately assessed uterine vs tubo-ovarian primaries for each block group. Results (not shown in detail) were "broadly consistent" with overall findings: **1-2 blocks not inferior to higher sampling**.

**Variables Tested** (1-2 blocks, grossly normal):
- Uterine vs tubo-ovarian: P = .34 (NS)
- Size below vs above median: P = .63 (NS)
- Neoadjuvant vs no neoadjuvant: P = .41 (NS overall cohort)

## Comparison to Prior Studies & Guidelines

### Prior Omentum Sampling Studies

| Study | Year | n | Primary Finding | Recommendation |
|-------|------|---|----------------|----------------|
| **Doig & Monaghan**<sup>14</sup> | 2006 | 332 | Grossly involved: 1 block sufficient | **1 block** (abnormal) |
| **Usubutun et al**<sup>15</sup> | 2007 | 258 | Grossly involved: 1 block sufficient | **1 block** (abnormal) |
| **Skala & Hagemann**<sup>16</sup> | 2015 | 44 | Simulated model: 5/10/14 blocks → 82%/95%/99% sensitivity | **10-14 blocks** (normal) |
| **Maglalang & Fadare** | 2025 | 1,055 | 1-2 blocks: MPR not inferior to higher sampling | **1-2 blocks** (all) |

**Note**: Skala & Hagemann 2015 used a **computer simulation model**, not empirical data, to estimate detection rates.

### Current International Guidelines

| Organization | Year | Recommendation | Citation |
|--------------|------|----------------|----------|
| **Royal College of Pathologists (RCP)** - Endometrial | 2017 | 2-4 blocks | "Based on accepted current practice"<sup>17</sup> |
| **RCP Best Practice** | 2025 | "Thorough sampling" if ovary malignant | Cites Doig & Monaghan<sup>18</sup> |
| **ISGyP** | 2019 | 1 section per 2-3 cm OR at least 4 blocks | Cites RCP & Usubutun<sup>19</sup> |
| **ICCR Endometrial** | 2022 | At least 4 blocks (grossly negative) | Endorses ISGyP<sup>20,21</sup> |
| **Westra et al (Textbook)** | 2003 | 5 sections (some say up to 10) | Grossing manual<sup>22</sup> |
| **Lester (Textbook)** | 2022 | Variable | Grossing manual<sup>23</sup> |

**Institutional Variability** (from publicly available gross manuals):
- Tubo-ovarian primary: **10 sections**
- Endometrial primary: **4 sections**
- General: **4-10 sections** range

**Discordance**: Current study (1-2 blocks) vs Guidelines (4-10 blocks) = **2-5× reduction**

---

## Critical Methodological Issues

### 1. Retrospective Design Limitations

**Heterogeneity Across 22 Years**:
- Multiple prosectors: residents, PA students, experienced PAs
- Variable gross descriptions ("interobserver variability")
- No standardized sectioning protocol
- Practice drift over time (2002 vs 2024 standards)

**Authors' Acknowledgment**:
> "Study cases were based on a review of pathology reports that were generated over a more than 20-year period, and as such, necessarily included descriptions from a spectrum of prosectors at widely varying levels of professional development."

**Implication**: The "1-2 blocks" finding may reflect **survivor bias** (cases where 1-2 blocks happened to capture disease).

---

### 2. Sampling Bias & Circular Reasoning

**The Paradox**:
- Prosectors who submitted 6 blocks likely sectioned more tissue
- If microscopic disease was **not** in those 6 blocks, it may not exist
- Comparing 6-block MPR (7.9%) to 1-block MPR (6.7%) assumes **random sampling**
- But prosectors may have **targeted** suspicious areas when submitting fewer blocks

**Example**:
- Grossly normal omentum, prosector sees subtle thickening
- Submits 2 blocks targeting that area → detects disease
- Another case: prosector sees truly normal omentum
- Submits 6 blocks randomly → no disease
- **Result**: 2-block MPR appears equivalent to 6-block MPR, but sampling strategies differ

**Authors' Note**:
> "Our analysis presumed appropriate sectioning and evaluations by a multitude of individuals over a long period."

**Problem**: "Appropriate sectioning" is undefined and likely variable.

---

### 3. Inadequate Gold Standard

**The MPR Trap**:
- MPR = microscopic positivity rate among blocks submitted
- **Does not measure**: how much disease was **missed**
- No complete sampling to establish true disease burden

**Example Scenario**:
- Grossly normal omentum, 2 blocks submitted, MPR = 7%
- What if complete sampling (100 blocks) would yield 15% MPR?
- The 2-block approach misses **~50% of microscopic disease**
- Study design **cannot detect this**

**Correct Methodology** (not used here):
1. Prosector submits initial blocks (e.g., 2 blocks)
2. Study pathologist then **completely samples** remaining tissue
3. Compare initial vs complete sampling MPR
4. Calculate **false negative rate**

**Skala & Hagemann 2015 Insight**:
- Used 44 cases with **known microscopic disease** (gold standard)
- Simulated random sampling: 5 blocks → 82% sensitivity, 10 blocks → 95%
- Shows **sampling matters when disease is sparse**

---

### 4. Statistical Power & Grouping Artifacts

**Block Group Imbalance**:
- 1-2 blocks: n=221 (41% of grossly normal)
- 3-4 blocks: n=67 (12%)
- 5-6 blocks: n=224 (42%)
- >6 blocks: n=24 (4%)

**Problem**: The 3-4 block group is **underpowered** (n=67, only 6 positive). A difference from 6.8% (1-2 blocks) to 9.0% (3-4 blocks) requires larger n to detect.

**Effect Size Calculation** (not performed by authors):
- To detect 3% absolute difference (6.8% vs 9.8%) with 80% power, α=.05:
- Required n ≈ 1,500 per group
- Study has n=221 and n=67 → **massively underpowered**

**Wide Confidence Intervals** (not reported):
- 1-2 blocks: 6.8% (15/221) → 95% CI: 4.0-11.0%
- 5-6 blocks: 8.5% (19/224) → 95% CI: 5.4-13.0%
- **Intervals overlap substantially** → cannot conclude equivalence

---

### 5. Clinical Outcome Not Assessed

**Missing Data**:
- No survival analysis
- No staging accuracy (understaged vs correctly staged)
- No treatment change analysis (adjuvant therapy decisions)
- No comparison to surgical findings (gross vs micro concordance consequences)

**Critical Question Unanswered**:
> If 1-2 blocks miss 5% of microscopic disease vs 5-6 blocks miss 2%, what is the **clinical impact**?

**Potential Impacts**:
- Stage IA → Stage IIIA upstaging affects adjuvant chemotherapy decisions
- Microscopic omental disease in "early-stage" endometrial cancer → platinum-based chemo consideration
- Survival: 2.3-3% early-stage ovarian cancers have occult disease (upstaged by omentectomy)<sup>6,7</sup>
- Endometrial: 0.4-1.9% have microscopic omental involvement<sup>8,9</sup>

**The Real Question**:
- Not "Does MPR differ statistically?"
- But "Does **understaging** from inadequate sampling harm patients?"

---

### 6. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Findings Underemphasized

**Significant Finding**:
- Post-neoadjuvant grossly normal omenta: **19.0% MPR** (vs 3.8% without neoadjuvant)
- **5× higher rate** of microscopic disease
- Small sample size (n=21 with neoadjuvant, 1-2 blocks)

**Authors' Caution**:
> "More extensive sampling of the omentum may be necessary in the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting, at least until the question can be specifically evaluated with larger datasets."

**Problem**: This is **buried in the discussion** and contradicts the main conclusion. Neoadjuvant cases represent a growing proportion of ovarian cancer cohorts (NACT increasingly used in advanced disease).

**Clinical Reality**:
- NACT response assessment is critical for surgical planning
- Gross appearance unreliable post-chemotherapy<sup>26</sup>
- Higher sampling needed → **but study recommends 1-2 blocks universally**

---

### 7. Focally Abnormal Group Paradox

**Data**:
- Focally abnormal overall MPR: 66.4% (93/140)
- **1-2 blocks**: 70.1% (53/75)
- **3-4 blocks**: 73.0% (27/37)
- **5-6 blocks**: 64.3% (9/14)
- **>6 blocks**: 28.6% (4/14)

**Authors' Interpretation**:
> "This finding may reflect the wide variety of gross aberrations... large subsets of which are ultimately found to be devoid of microscopic abnormality."

**Alternative Interpretation**:
- Focal abnormalities are **high-risk** for false negatives
- 33.6% (47/140) were grossly suspicious but **microscopically negative**
- These are the **hardest to classify** cases
- May require **more sampling**, not less

**Clinical Scenario**:
- Surgeon describes "questionable 2 cm nodule" on omentum
- Pathologist submits 2 blocks from nodule → negative
- Was the nodule benign (reactive)? Or did we **miss** disease in the other 98% of the omentum?

---

### 8. Block-to-Size Ratio Misuse

**Concept**:
- Block-to-size ratio = blocks ÷ widest dimension
- Example: 6 blocks ÷ 30 cm = 20%

**Authors' Finding**:
- No correlation between ratio and MPR (P=.72)
- Ratios 1-10% vs 40%+ had similar MPR (~8-10%)

**Problem**:
- **Denominator is one-dimensional** (widest diameter)
- Omentum is **three-dimensional** and irregular
- Volume varies enormously (thin vs bulky)
- 6 blocks from 100g omentum ≠ 6 blocks from 500g omentum

**Better Metric**: Blocks per gram or blocks per estimated volume (not used)

**Surface Area Issue**:
- Microscopic disease is **surface phenomenon** (peritoneal implants)
- One-dimensional size (longest diameter) ignores surface area complexity

---

## Comparison to Pancreatic LN Adequacy Literature

**Parallel Issues**:

| Issue | Pancreatic LN Studies | Omentum Study (Maglalang 2025) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Sampling bias** | Stage migration from inadequate LN harvest | MPR measured without gold standard |
| **False negative modeling** | Binomial/hypergeometric models (Pu 2021, Yoon 2025) | **Not modeled** |
| **Survival outcomes** | Demonstrated 8-month advantage (Tomlinson 2007) | **Not assessed** |
| **Detection probability** | P=1-(1-p)^n framework | **Not calculated** |
| **Consensus building** | 12-16 LN from 3 studies | 1-2 blocks (conflicts with guidelines) |

**Methodological Gold Standard** (from LN studies):
1. **Binomial model**: P(detection) = 1 - (1 - prevalence)^n
   - Prevalence = disease rate per unit sampled
   - n = number of units sampled
   - Yields minimum n for desired confidence (e.g., 95%)

2. **Hypergeometric model** (finite population):
   - Accounts for total finite nodes
   - More accurate than binomial for small populations

3. **False N0 (false negative) quantification**:
   - Yoon 2025: 16 LN → 18.9% false N0 rate
   - **Omentum equivalent**: With 2 blocks, what % of "negative" cases are false negatives?

**Application to Omentum**:
- Estimate disease burden per cubic centimeter (from complete sampling subset)
- Model: How many blocks needed for 90%, 95%, 99% detection?
- Compare to clinical outcomes (survival, stage accuracy)

---

## Statistical Reanalysis Recommendations

### 1. Power Analysis

**Current Study Lacks**:
- Prospective power calculation
- Confidence intervals for MPR
- Non-inferiority margin definition

**Needed**:
- Define clinically acceptable difference (e.g., ≤2% absolute MPR difference)
- Calculate required sample size
- Report 95% CI for all MPR estimates

**Example**:
- 1-2 blocks: 6.8% (95% CI: 4.0-11.0%)
- 5-6 blocks: 8.5% (95% CI: 5.4-13.0%)
- **Overlapping CI → cannot conclude non-inferiority**

---

### 2. Equivalence Testing

**Current Approach**: Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
- H₀: MPR₁₋₂ = MPR₅₋₆
- Result: P > .50 (fail to reject null)
- **Problem**: Failing to reject null ≠ proving equivalence

**Correct Approach**: Non-inferiority or equivalence testing
- Define margin: Δ = 2% (clinically acceptable difference)
- H₀: MPR₁₋₂ - MPR₅₋₆ ≥ Δ (inferior)
- H₁: MPR₁₋₂ - MPR₅₋₆ < Δ (non-inferior)
- Calculate one-sided 97.5% CI for difference
- If upper CI < Δ → non-inferiority established

**Why It Matters**:
- Current study: "No difference found" = insufficient evidence
- Proper test: "Proven non-inferior" = positive evidence

---

### 3. Bayesian Reanalysis

**Frequentist Limitation**:
- P-value only addresses "if null true, how likely is this data?"
- Doesn't answer "given this data, what's the probability 1-2 blocks are adequate?"

**Bayesian Approach**:
- Prior: ISGyP guidelines (4 blocks) based on expert consensus
- Likelihood: Maglalang data (MPR by block groups)
- Posterior: Updated probability that 1-2 blocks are adequate
- Incorporate uncertainty, not just point estimates

**Example Output**:
- Probability that 1-2 blocks detect ≥90% of disease: 65%
- Probability that 5-6 blocks detect ≥90% of disease: 85%
- Decision: 5-6 blocks preferred (higher confidence)

---

### 4. Survival & Staging Outcome Analysis

**Required Comparison**:
| Outcome | 1-2 Blocks | 5-6 Blocks | P-value | HR (95% CI) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Upstaging rate | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 5-year OS | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Adjuvant chemo use | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Endpoint**: Does lower sampling lead to **understaging → undertreatment → worse survival**?

---

## How the Omentum Study Should Respond

### Study Design: Prospective Validation

**Objective**: Validate or refute Maglalang & Fadare 2025 findings with methodologically rigorous design.

**Design**: Prospective, two-phase sampling study

**Phase 1: Complete Sampling Gold Standard** (n=200 target)
1. Surgeon performs omentectomy (standard practice)
2. **Standardized grossing protocol**:
   - Measure dimensions (length, width, thickness)
   - Weigh specimen
   - Photograph
   - Section at **uniform 5mm intervals**
3. **Prosector blinded sampling**:
   - Submit initial 2 blocks (standardized: 1 from each end)
   - Record block locations (photograph)
4. **Pathologist complete sampling**:
   - Submit **ALL remaining tissue** in sequential blocks
   - Label blocks sequentially (Block 3, 4, 5... N)
5. **Histologic review**:
   - Initial 2 blocks read first (report "provisional diagnosis")
   - Complete sampling read second (report "final diagnosis")
   - Compare: concordance, discordance, additional findings

**Outcomes Measured**:
- **Sensitivity**: 2-block sampling vs complete sampling (gold standard)
- **False Negative Rate**: Negative on 2 blocks, positive on complete sampling
- **Number Needed to Sample (NNS)**: How many blocks to achieve 90%, 95%, 99% sensitivity?
- **Predictors of missed disease**: tumor type, gross appearance, specimen size

---

**Phase 2: Probabilistic Modeling** (using Phase 1 data)

**Binomial Detection Model**:
- Estimate disease prevalence per block (p) from Phase 1
- Calculate: P(detection) = 1 - (1 - p)^n
- Derive minimum n for 95% confidence

**Hypergeometric Model** (finite blocks):
- Total blocks available: N
- Diseased blocks: K
- Blocks sampled: n
- Probability of detecting ≥1 diseased block: P(X≥1)

**Tissue Volume Model**:
- Estimate disease burden per cm³
- Calculate blocks needed based on specimen volume (not just linear dimension)

**Clinical Cutoff Optimization**:
- ROC curve: blocks sampled vs upstaging accuracy
- Optimal cutoff: maximize Youden index (sensitivity + specificity - 1)

---

### Subgroup Stratification

**Mandatory Subgroups** (addressing Maglalang limitations):

1. **Gross Appearance**:
   - Normal (with photo documentation)
   - Focally abnormal (measure lesion size)
   - Multifocally abnormal (count lesions)
   - Diffusely abnormal

2. **Primary Site**:
   - Tubo-ovarian/peritoneal
   - Endometrial (separate low-grade vs high-grade vs serous)

3. **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy**:
   - No neoadjuvant (upfront surgery)
   - Post-neoadjuvant (response assessment critical)

4. **Specimen Characteristics**:
   - Weight: <100g, 100-300g, >300g
   - Maximum dimension: <15cm, 15-30cm, >30cm

5. **Surgical Extent**:
   - Partial omentectomy
   - Complete omentectomy (infracolic vs supracolic)

---

### Clinical Outcome Integration

**Follow-Up Data Collection** (minimum 5 years):

1. **Immediate Outcomes**:
   - Stage assigned (initial 2-block diagnosis vs complete sampling diagnosis)
   - Stage migration rate (understaging frequency)
   - Adjuvant treatment decision change (did additional findings alter therapy?)

2. **Long-Term Outcomes**:
   - Recurrence-free survival (RFS)
   - Overall survival (OS)
   - Site of first recurrence (peritoneal vs distant)
   - Association between sampling adequacy and survival

**Cox Regression Model**:
- Covariates: age, stage, grade, histotype, residual disease, sampling adequacy
- Primary exposure: "adequate sampling" (defined by study findings)
- Outcome: OS, RFS

**Hypothesis**:
- **If Maglalang correct**: No survival difference between 2-block vs 6-block sampling
- **If Maglalang incorrect**: Higher sampling → higher upstaging → appropriate adjuvant therapy → improved OS

---

### Statistical Analysis Plan

**Primary Endpoint**: Sensitivity of 2-block sampling vs complete sampling

**Sample Size Calculation**:
- Expected sensitivity: 85% (hypothesis: 2 blocks miss 15% of cases)
- Precision: ±5% (95% CI)
- Required n ≈ 200 grossly normal cases

**Analysis**:
1. **Sensitivity/Specificity**: 2 blocks vs gold standard
2. **Predictive Values**: PPV/NPV of 2-block diagnosis
3. **ROC Analysis**: Optimal block number (maximize AUC)
4. **Logistic Regression**: Predictors of false negatives
5. **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, Cox regression

**Non-Inferiority Testing**:
- Margin: 5% absolute decrease in sensitivity acceptable
- H₀: Sensitivity₂ₐₗₒcₖₛ - Sensitivitycomplete ≤ -5%
- α = 0.025 (one-sided)

---

### Innovations Beyond Maglalang Study

**1. Three-Dimensional Tissue Mapping**:
- Digitize gross specimen (photogrammetry)
- Map each block location in 3D space
- Correlate disease distribution with sampling strategy
- Identify "cold spots" (missed areas)

**2. Machine Learning Classification**:
- Input: gross appearance, dimensions, weight, tumor type, neoadjuvant status
- Output: predicted probability of microscopic disease
- Use to triage sampling intensity (high-risk → more blocks)

**3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
- Cost: Additional histology (blocks, slides, pathologist time)
- Benefit: Correct staging, appropriate treatment, survival gain
- Outcome: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
- Compare: 2 blocks vs 6 blocks vs risk-stratified approach

**4. International Collaboration**:
- Multi-center validation (avoid single-institution bias)
- Geographic diversity (surgical practices vary)
- Larger sample size → greater power

## Positioning as Critical Response

### Narrative Framework

**Problem Statement**:
> Maglalang & Fadare (2025) concluded that 1-2 blocks are sufficient for omentum sampling in gynecologic cancers, challenging established international guidelines recommending 4-10 blocks. However, their retrospective design lacks a gold standard for comparison, precluding assessment of false negative rates and clinical impact.

**Research Gap**:
> No prospective study has systematically compared limited sampling to complete sampling with clinical outcome correlation. The true sensitivity of 1-2 blocks remains unknown.

**Hypothesis**:
> We hypothesize that 1-2 block sampling has insufficient sensitivity (<90%) for detecting microscopic omental disease in high-risk scenarios (post-neoadjuvant, aggressive histotypes, focally abnormal gross appearance), leading to understaging and potential undertreatment.

**Study Aim**:
> To establish the diagnostic accuracy of limited-block omentum sampling using complete tissue sampling as the gold standard, and to assess the clinical impact of sampling adequacy on staging and survival.

### Key Messages

**Methodological Critique**:
1. "Retrospective designs without gold standard comparison cannot establish false negative rates."
2. "MPR equivalence does not prove sampling adequacy—only prospective validation can."
3. "Missing clinical outcome data (survival, staging accuracy) is a critical limitation."

**Clinical Concerns**:
1. "Early-stage gynecologic cancers rely on omentectomy for upstaging—missing microscopic disease has treatment consequences."
2. "Post-neoadjuvant cases show 5× higher microscopic disease (19% vs 4%)—requires more sampling, not less."
3. "Focally abnormal omenta (27% of abnormal cases) have 66% MPR—high false-positive concern demands adequate sampling."

**Innovation**:
1. "First prospective study with complete sampling gold standard."
2. "Integration of binomial detection modeling from oncology staging literature."
3. "Clinical outcome correlation (survival) addresses patient-centered endpoints."

## Implementation in Pathsampling Module

### New Analysis: Omentum Adequacy Assessment

**User Input Variables**:
1. Omentum gross appearance (normal, focal, multifocal, diffuse)
2. Number of blocks submitted
3. Specimen dimensions (length, width, weight if available)
4. Primary tumor site (ovarian, endometrial, etc.)
5. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes/no)
6. Histologic diagnosis (tumor type)

**Calculations**:
1. **Block-to-size ratio** (blocks ÷ widest dimension)
2. **Expected MPR** (based on Maglalang data + our validation data)
3. **Estimated sensitivity** (from our prospective model)
4. **False negative risk** (probability of missed disease)
5. **Adequacy classification**:
   - **Inadequate**: <2 blocks or high false-negative risk scenario
   - **Marginal**: 2-3 blocks, intermediate risk
   - **Adequate**: ≥4 blocks (guideline-concordant)
   - **Excellent**: Risk-stratified approach (e.g., 6+ blocks post-neoadjuvant)

**Risk Stratification Table**:
| Scenario | Maglalang MPR | Our Sensitivity | Recommended Blocks | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Normal, no NACT, ovarian | 8.6% | TBD | ≥4 | ISGyP guideline |
| Normal, post-NACT, ovarian | 19.0% | TBD | ≥6 | High false-negative risk |
| Multifocal/diffuse abnormal | 92.1% | TBD | 2-3 | High pre-test probability |
| Focal abnormal | 66.4% | TBD | ≥4 | Heterogeneous, high FP risk |
| Normal, endometrial | 5.6% | TBD | ≥4 | Low pre-test, but staging critical |

=== Omentum Sampling Adequacy Analysis ===

Specimen Characteristics:
- Gross Appearance: Normal
- Dimensions: 25 × 15 cm
- Primary: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
- Neoadjuvant: Yes
- Blocks Submitted: 2

Adequacy Assessment:
- Block-to-size ratio: 8% (2 blocks ÷ 25 cm)
- Expected MPR: 19.0% (post-NACT, normal appearance)
- Estimated Sensitivity: 75% (95% CI: 60-85%)
- False Negative Risk: 25%
- Classification: ⚠️ INADEQUATE

Recommendation:
Given post-neoadjuvant status and high-grade histology, at least 6 blocks recommended
(Maglalang et al. 2025: 5× higher MPR in post-NACT cases; Our data: sensitivity <90%
with 2 blocks in this scenario).

Clinical Implication:
Potential understaging risk. If staging influences adjuvant therapy decisions, consider
additional sampling if tissue remains.

<h4>Omentum Sampling Adequacy: Evidence Review</h4>

<p><b>Background:</b> International guidelines (ISGyP, ICCR) recommend ≥4 blocks
for grossly normal omentum in gynecologic cancer staging. A recent large
retrospective study (Maglalang & Fadare 2025, n=1,055) suggested 1-2 blocks
may be sufficient, but this conclusion lacks gold standard validation.</p>

<p><b>Critical Limitations of Retrospective Data:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>No complete sampling reference → false negative rate unknown</li>
    <li>Sampling bias: variable prosector practices over 22 years</li>
    <li>No clinical outcome correlation (survival, staging accuracy)</li>
    <li>Post-neoadjuvant cases show 5× higher MPR (19% vs 4%, P=.03)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Our Prospective Validation:</b> [Summary of findings - TBD]</p>

<p><b>Consensus Recommendation:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Standard cases:</b> ≥4 blocks (ISGyP guideline-concordant)</li>
    <li><b>Post-neoadjuvant:</b> ≥6 blocks (higher microscopic disease risk)</li>
    <li><b>Multifocal/diffuse abnormal:</b> 2-3 blocks (high pre-test probability)</li>
    <li><b>Focal abnormal:</b> ≥4 blocks (heterogeneous, requires thorough sampling)</li>

## Conclusion

The Maglalang & Fadare 2025 study represents the largest cohort to date examining omentum sampling adequacy but suffers from critical methodological limitations inherent to retrospective designs. Their conclusion that 1-2 blocks are sufficient contradicts established international guidelines and lacks the gold standard comparison necessary to assess false negative rates.

**Our prospective omentum study will**:
1. Provide definitive sensitivity data using complete sampling as the gold standard
2. Quantify false negative rates and clinical impact (staging, survival)
3. Validate or refute Maglalang's findings with methodological rigor
4. Establish evidence-based recommendations for pathology practice

**The pathsampling module will**:
1. Integrate omentum adequacy assessment alongside lymph node analysis
2. Risk-stratify sampling recommendations based on clinical scenario
3. Provide real-time feedback to pathologists during grossing
4. Support quality assurance and guideline adherence

This represents a critical response to a potentially practice-changing publication, ensuring patient safety through rigorous validation before widespread adoption of reduced sampling protocols.
