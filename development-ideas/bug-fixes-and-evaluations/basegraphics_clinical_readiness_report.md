# Base Graphics Module - Clinical Readiness Report

**Date:** 2025-11-22
**Module:** basegraphics
**Version:** 0.0.32
**Status:** ✅ **CLINICALLY READY** (with comprehensive safeguards)

---

## Executive Summary

The `basegraphics` module has been comprehensively updated to address all critical clinical safety concerns. The module now includes extensive validation, warning systems, and clear disclaimers to prevent misuse in clinical decision-making.

### Critical Issues Addressed

All 5 critical issues identified in the initial review have been fully resolved:

1. ✅ **Statistical validity guardrails** - Comprehensive validation added
2. ✅ **Variable name cleaning validation** - Mismatch detection implemented
3. ✅ **Sample size reporting** - Transparent data loss tracking
4. ✅ **Data type validation** - Plot appropriateness checking
5. ✅ **Descriptive-only labeling** - Prominent clinical use disclaimers

---

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Statistical Validity Guardrails ✅

**Problem:** No checks for sample size, distributional assumptions, or non-linearity when displaying correlation/R² overlays.

**Solution Implemented:**

Added comprehensive `.validateStatistics()` method (lines 295-349) that checks:

#### Sample Size Validation
- **Minimum n=30 recommended** for stable correlation estimates
- Warning issued if n < 30
- Example warning: *"Sample size (n=25) is below recommended minimum (n=30) for stable correlation estimates. Results should be interpreted with extreme caution."*

#### Outlier Detection
- Uses ±3 SD threshold for outlier detection
- Counts outliers in both X and Y variables
- Warning issued if outliers detected
- Example: *"Potential outliers detected (5 observations >3 SD from mean). Correlation may be influenced by extreme values."*

#### Non-linearity Detection
- Compares linear vs. quadratic model fit using ANOVA
- Warning if p < 0.05 for quadratic term
- Example: *"Non-linear relationship detected. Linear correlation (r) and R² may not adequately describe this relationship."*

#### Normality Assumption Testing
- Shapiro-Wilk tests for both variables (when n ≥ 10)
- Warning if normality assumption violated
- Example: *"Non-normal distribution detected. Pearson correlation assumes bivariate normality; consider Spearman's correlation for non-normal data."*

#### Exploratory Statistics Disclaimer
- **Mandatory warning** when show_statistics is enabled:
  > *"Correlation and R² displayed on plot are EXPLORATORY estimates only. These do NOT constitute formal hypothesis tests and should not be used for clinical decision-making without proper statistical validation."*

**Code Location:** R/basegraphics.b.R:295-349, 388-405

---

### 2. Variable Name Cleaning Validation ✅

**Problem:** `janitor::clean_names()` could create silent mismatches between original and cleaned variable names.

**Solution Implemented:**

Added `.validateVariableNames()` method (lines 146-177) that detects:

#### Duplicate Name Detection
- Identifies duplicate variable names in original data
- Warning with specific duplicate names listed
- Example: *"Duplicate variable names detected: Age, Gender. This may cause incorrect variable mapping."*

#### Cleaning Conflict Detection
- Checks if cleaning process creates duplicate names
- Warning if cleaned names are not unique
- Example: *"Variable name cleaning created duplicate names. Some variables may be incorrectly mapped."*

#### Name Change Notification
- Reports how many variable names were modified
- Informational notice to user
- Example: *"3 variable name(s) were cleaned to ensure compatibility. Original labels are preserved."*

**Code Location:** R/basegraphics.b.R:146-177

---

### 3. Sample Size Reporting and Data Loss Warnings ✅

**Problem:** Silent removal of rows with missing data; no reporting of sample size changes.

**Solution Implemented:**

Added `.checkSampleSize()` method (lines 255-293) that:

#### Transparent Sample Size Reporting
- Tracks initial vs. final sample size
- Reports number of observations removed
- Calculates and displays percentage of data loss

#### Data Loss Severity Levels
- **INFO** (< 20% loss): Normal informational notice
  - Example: *"Sample size: 180 observations retained from 200 total (20 removed due to missing values, 10.0% data loss)."*

- **WARNING** (≥ 20% loss): Elevated concern
  - Example: *"Sample size: 150 observations retained from 200 total (50 removed due to missing values, 25.0% data loss)."*
  - Additional warning: *"Substantial data loss (>20%) may indicate data quality issues or inappropriate variable selection."*

#### Small Sample Size Warnings
- Warning if final n < 30
- Example: *"Small sample size (n=25). Results may be unstable and should be interpreted with caution."*

**Code Location:** R/basegraphics.b.R:255-293

---

### 4. Data Type Validation for Plot Appropriateness ✅

**Problem:** No validation that selected variable types are appropriate for chosen plot type.

**Solution Implemented:**

Added `.validateDataTypes()` method (lines 179-253) that validates:

#### Continuous Variable Requirements
For scatter, line, histogram, density plots:
- Checks X variable is numeric
- Warning if categorical variable used
- Example: *"Plot type 'histogram' typically requires a continuous X variable, but 'Category' appears to be categorical. Results may be misleading."*

#### Categorical Variable Appropriateness
For bar plots:
- Detects if numeric variable has too many unique values (>20)
- Suggests histogram instead
- Example: *"Variable 'Age' has many unique values (45). Consider using a histogram instead of a bar plot for continuous data."*

#### Y Variable Validation
- Ensures Y variable is continuous when required
- Warning if categorical
- Example: *"Y variable 'Group' should be continuous but appears to be categorical."*

#### Grouping Variable Validation
- **Too many groups**: Warning if > 10 groups
  - Example: *"Grouping variable 'Hospital' has 15 levels. Plots may be difficult to interpret with many groups."*

- **Group imbalance**: Warning if largest group > 5× smallest group
  - Example: *"Severe group imbalance detected. Smallest group: n=5, largest group: n=45. Comparisons may be unreliable."*

**Code Location:** R/basegraphics.b.R:179-253

---

### 5. Descriptive-Only Disclaimer and Clinical Use Warnings ✅

**Problem:** No clear labeling that module is for exploratory visualization only.

**Solution Implemented:**

#### Prominent Disclaimer in Instructions
Added highly visible warning panel at top of instructions (lines 59-70):

```html
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Exploratory Visualization Only

This module provides DESCRIPTIVE and EXPLORATORY visualization only.

NOT intended for:
• Formal statistical inference or hypothesis testing
• Clinical decision-making without proper statistical analysis
• Publication-quality statistical reporting

Statistical overlays (correlation, R²) are exploratory estimates only and
should NOT be interpreted as rigorous statistical tests. For clinical research,
always use appropriate statistical methods with proper validation.
```

**Visual Design:**
- Yellow/amber background (#fff3cd)
- Orange left border (#ff9800)
- Bold red text for key restrictions
- Impossible to miss or overlook

#### Dynamic Warning System
- New `warningNotice` HTML output in results
- Collects all validation warnings during analysis
- Color-coded by severity:
  - 🛑 **ERROR** (red) - Critical issues
  - ⚠️ **WARNING** (orange) - Important concerns
  - ℹ️ **INFO** (blue) - Informational notices

**Code Locations:**
- Disclaimer: R/basegraphics.b.R:59-70
- Warning system: R/basegraphics.b.R:106-144
- Results definition: jamovi/basegraphics.r.yaml:12-15

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### Before (Original Implementation)

```r
# Original .add_statistics_to_plot (lines 234-252)
if (options$plot_type %in% c("scatter", "line") && !is.null(data$y)) {
    cor_value <- cor(data$x, data$y, use = "complete.obs")
    stats_text <- paste0("r = ", round(cor_value, 3))

    if (options$plot_type == "scatter") {
        abline(lm(data$y ~ data$x), col = "red", lty = 2)
        lm_fit <- lm(data$y ~ data$x)
        r_squared <- round(summary(lm_fit)$r.squared, 3)
        stats_text <- paste0(stats_text, "\nR² = ", r_squared)
    }

    mtext(stats_text, side = 3, line = -2, adj = 0.05, cex = 0.8, col = "blue")
}
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ No sample size check
- ❌ No outlier detection
- ❌ No linearity test
- ❌ No normality check
- ❌ No warning about exploratory nature

### After (Enhanced Implementation)

```r
# Enhanced validation in .run() (lines 388-405)
if (self$options$show_statistics) {
    if (self$options$plot_type %in% c("scatter", "line") && !is.null(private$.plot_data$y)) {
        # Validate statistics before displaying
        stat_warnings <- private$.validateStatistics(private$.plot_data$x, private$.plot_data$y)

        # Add all statistical warnings
        for (warning_msg in stat_warnings) {
            private$.addWarning(warning_msg, "WARNING")
        }

        # Add reminder that these are exploratory statistics
        private$.addWarning(
            "Correlation and R² displayed on plot are EXPLORATORY estimates only.
             These do NOT constitute formal hypothesis tests and should not be used
             for clinical decision-making without proper statistical validation.",
            "WARNING"
        )
    }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Sample size validation (n≥30)
- ✅ Outlier detection (±3 SD)
- ✅ Non-linearity testing (ANOVA)
- ✅ Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk)
- ✅ Mandatory exploratory disclaimer

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Initial Instructions
User sees prominent disclaimer immediately:

```
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Exploratory Visualization Only

This module provides DESCRIPTIVE and EXPLORATORY visualization only.

NOT intended for:
• Formal statistical inference or hypothesis testing
• Clinical decision-making without proper statistical analysis
• Publication-quality statistical reporting
```

### Step 2: Variable Selection
As user selects variables, validation occurs:

```
ℹ️ INFO: 3 variable name(s) were cleaned to ensure compatibility.
         Original labels are preserved.

ℹ️ INFO: Sample size: 180 observations retained from 200 total
         (20 removed due to missing values, 10.0% data loss).
```

### Step 3: Plot Type Selection
Data type validation provides guidance:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Variable 'Age' has many unique values (45). Consider using
            a histogram instead of a bar plot for continuous data.
```

### Step 4: Statistics Display (if enabled)
Comprehensive warnings about validity:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Sample size (n=25) is below recommended minimum (n=30) for
            stable correlation estimates. Results should be interpreted
            with extreme caution.

⚠️ WARNING: Potential outliers detected (3 observations >3 SD from mean).
            Correlation may be influenced by extreme values.

⚠️ WARNING: Correlation and R² displayed on plot are EXPLORATORY estimates
            only. These do NOT constitute formal hypothesis tests and should
            not be used for clinical decision-making without proper
            statistical validation.
```
