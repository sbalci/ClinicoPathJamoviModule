# Orange-Peeling Lymph Node Dissection in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma - Analysis and Implementation Insights

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes a study comparing **orange-peeling (OP)** vs **conventional (CONV)** lymph node dissection techniques in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The study introduces **hypergeometric analysis** as a novel approach to determine minimum lymph node requirements, which has significant implications for our pathsampling jamovi implementation and omentum analysis.

## Key Findings at a Glance

### What Orange-Peeling Achieves

✅ **Increases total LN yield**: Median 23 vs 16 LN (p < 0.001, δ = 0.424)
✅ **Improves adequacy**: 91.9% vs 77.0% achieve ≥12 LN (p < 0.001, OR = 3.37)
✅ **Medium-large effect size**: Cliff's δ = 0.424, Hodges-Lehmann shift = +6 LN

### What Orange-Peeling Does NOT Change

❌ **Metastatic LN count**: Median 2 vs 1 (p = 0.163, δ = 0.070)
❌ **LN ratio**: Median 0.08-0.09 in both (p = 0.731, δ = -0.017)
❌ **Stage distribution**: No Will Rogers phenomenon (p = 0.497)

### Critical Insight

**Orange-peeling improves ADEQUACY, not disease detection.** It increases the total LN pool without finding more metastases, suggesting conventional methods are missing non-metastatic nodes, not metastatic ones.

## Methodological Innovation: Hypergeometric Analysis

### What is Hypergeometric Analysis?

The **hypergeometric distribution** models sampling **without replacement** from a finite population:

**Formula**:
```
P(X = k) = C(K, k) × C(N-K, n-k) / C(N, n)

Where:
N = Total population size (total LN in specimen)
K = Success states in population (metastatic LN)
n = Number of draws (LN examined by pathologist)
k = Observed successes (metastatic LN found)
```

**Application to LN Sampling**:
- **N**: True total LN in the specimen (unknown, must be estimated)
- **K**: True metastatic LN (unknown, must be estimated)
- **n**: LN examined by pathologist (what we control)
- **k**: Metastatic LN found (what we observe)

**Question**: How many LN (n) must we examine to have ≥90% or ≥95% confidence of detecting ≥1 metastatic LN (for N1 staging) or ≥4 metastatic LN (for N2 staging)?

---

### Why Hypergeometric vs Binomial?

Our current pathsampling implementation uses **binomial probability**:

**Binomial Model** (current):
```r
P(detect ≥1) = 1 - (1-p)^n
```
- Assumes sampling **with replacement**
- Assumes **infinite population**
- Estimates **p** from first detection data

**Hypergeometric Model** (new):
```r
P(detect ≥k) = 1 - sum(dhyper(0:(k-1), K, N-K, n))
```
- Models sampling **without replacement** (realistic!)
- Uses **finite population** (actual LN pool)
- Requires estimates of **N** (total LN) and **K** (metastatic LN)

**When to Use Which?**

| Scenario | Best Model | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Omentum metastasis** (presence/absence) | Binomial | Large tissue area, "infinite" sampling locations, rare event |
| **Lymph node dissection** (finite pool) | Hypergeometric | Finite LN pool, sampling exhausts population |
| **LVSI foci** (multiple slides) | Binomial | Large tissue volume, many potential foci |
| **Tumor-positive cassettes** (out of N total) | Hypergeometric | Finite cassette pool, sampling without replacement |

**Key Insight**: Hypergeometric is more accurate when the sampling fraction (n/N) is substantial (>10%). Binomial approximates hypergeometric when n << N.

## Orange-Peeling Study Results

### 1. Total LN Yield

**All Cases** (n=521):
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 23 LN (IQR 17-31)
- **Conventional**: Median 16 LN (IQR 12-21)
- **Statistics**: U = 19,092.5, p ≈ 1.2×10⁻¹⁶
- **Effect size**: Cliff's δ = 0.424 (medium-large), Hodges-Lehmann shift = +6 LN

**PDAC-only** (n=209):
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 24 LN
- **Conventional**: Median 18 LN
- **Statistics**: U = 7,601, p ≈ 3.7×10⁻⁹
- **Effect size**: Cliff's δ = 0.49 (medium-large)

**LN-positive subset** (n=338):
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 24 LN
- **Conventional**: Median 17.5 LN
- **Statistics**: p < 0.0001, Cliff's δ = -0.41 (medium)

**Interpretation**:
- Orange-peeling consistently yields **6 more LN** across all cohorts
- Effect is robust (medium-large effect sizes)
- Achieves statistical significance in every analysis

---

### 2. Metastatic LN Count

**All Cases**:
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 2 LN (IQR 0-5)
- **Conventional**: Median 1 LN (IQR 0-4)
- **Statistics**: U = 30,836, p = 0.163 (NOT significant)
- **Effect size**: Cliff's δ = 0.070 (negligible)

**PDAC-only**:
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 3 LN
- **Conventional**: Median 3 LN
- **Statistics**: No difference

**LN-positive only**:
- **Orange-peeling**: Median 4 LN
- **Conventional**: Median 3 LN
- **Statistics**: p = 0.21 (NOT significant)

**Critical Finding**: Orange-peeling does NOT increase metastatic LN detection!

---

### 3. LN Ratio

**All Cases**:
- **Both groups**: Median 0.08-0.09
- **Statistics**: U = 33,722, p = 0.731 (NOT significant)
- **Effect size**: Cliff's δ = -0.017 (no effect)

**LN-positive subset**:
- **Orange-peeling**: 0.157
- **Conventional**: 0.195
- **Statistics**: p = 0.046 (borderline significant, LOWER in OP)

**Interpretation**:
- LN ratio actually DECREASES with orange-peeling (more denominator, same numerator)
- This is expected if OP finds more negative LN, not more positive LN
- LN ratio may be misleading when technique varies

---

### 4. Adequacy (≥12 LN)

**All Cases**:
- **Orange-peeling**: 91.9% (203/221)
- **Conventional**: 77.0% (231/300)
- **Statistics**: χ² = 19.13, p ≈ 1.2×10⁻⁵
- **Effect measures**:
  - OR = 3.37 (95% CI 1.94-5.85) - 3.4× higher odds
  - RR = 1.19 - 19% relative increase
  - RD = +14.9% - 15 more adequate cases per 100
  - φ = 0.192 (small-medium correlation)

**PDAC-only**:
- **Orange-peeling**: 97.4% (76/78)
- **Conventional**: 86.3% (113/131)

**LN-positive subset**:
- **Orange-peeling**: 94%
- **Conventional**: 83%
- **Statistics**: p = 0.0045, Cramer's V = 0.15

**Interpretation**:
- Orange-peeling dramatically improves adequacy achievement
- Near-universal adequacy (97.4%) in PDAC with OP
- This is the PRIMARY clinical benefit

---

### 5. Stage Migration Analysis

**All Cases** (N0 / N1 / N2):
- **Orange-peeling**: 33.0% / 31.2% / 35.7%
- **Conventional**: 36.7% / 32.3% / 31.0%
- **Statistics**: χ² = 1.40, p = 0.497 (NOT significant)

**PDAC-only** (N0 / N1 / N2):
- **Orange-peeling**: 15.4% / 35.9% / 48.7%
- **Conventional**: 19.8% / 35.9% / 44.3%
- **Statistics**: χ² = 0.689, p = 0.75 (NOT significant)

**LN-positive only** (N1 / N2):
- **Orange-peeling**: 47% / 53%
- **Conventional**: 51% / 49%
- **Statistics**: p = 0.48 (NOT significant)

**Critical Finding**: NO Will Rogers phenomenon!

**Interpretation**:
- Orange-peeling does NOT cause stage migration
- This is reassuring - it means the extra LN found are predominantly negative
- The biological stage distribution is unaffected
- Quality improvement (adequacy) without stage inflation

## Hypergeometric Analysis Results

### Minimum LN Requirements

The study used hypergeometric analysis to determine minimum LN examination requirements:

#### To Detect ≥1 Positive LN (Avoid Missing N1)

**90% Confidence**:
- Conventional: ~8 LN required
- Orange-peeling: ~10 LN required

**95% Confidence**:
- Conventional: ~10 LN required
- Orange-peeling: ~12 LN required

#### To Detect ≥4 Positive LN (Avoid Missing N2)

**90% Confidence**:
- Conventional: ~13-14 LN required
- Orange-peeling: ~17-18 LN required

**95% Confidence**:
- Conventional: ~14 LN required
- Orange-peeling: ~18 LN required

**PDAC-only LN-positive**: Similar patterns, slightly higher numbers (especially in OP)

---

### Interpretation of Hypergeometric Results

**Why does OP require MORE LN for same confidence?**

This seems counterintuitive! Orange-peeling yields more LN, so shouldn't it need FEWER LN examined?

**Answer**: It's about the **sampling fraction** (n/N).

- **Conventional**: Total pool N ≈ 16-18 LN
  - To find ≥1 positive with 95% confidence: need 10 LN
  - Sampling fraction: 10/16 = 62.5%

- **Orange-peeling**: Total pool N ≈ 23-24 LN
  - To find ≥1 positive with 95% confidence: need 12 LN
  - Sampling fraction: 12/24 = 50%

**The larger pool (OP) requires a larger absolute number (n) to maintain the same sampling fraction and confidence.**

**Clinical Implication**:
- The ≥12 LN adequacy criterion is more appropriate for orange-peeling than conventional
- Conventional dissection should perhaps require ≥10 LN (not 12)
- Or, technique should be standardized (all use OP → all use ≥12 criterion)

## Comparison to Existing Literature

### Ates et al. (2025) - LVSI in Endometrium

| Feature | Orange-peeling PDAC LN | Ates LVSI |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Tissue** | Pancreatic LN | Endometrial tumor |
| **Method** | Orange-peeling vs conventional | Sampling intensity (blocks) |
| **Optimal samples** | 17-18 LN (95% for N2) | 7 blocks (plateau) |
| **Statistical approach** | Hypergeometric | ROC analysis |
| **Adequacy threshold** | ≥12 LN | ≥5 foci |
| **Stage migration** | None (p=0.497) | Yes (40% difference) |
| **Key finding** | OP improves adequacy, not detection | Single vs summed matters |

**Similarity**: Both show technique/sampling intensity matters
**Difference**: Ates found stage migration; orange-peeling did NOT

**Why the difference?**
- **Ates**: Inadequate sampling MISSES disease (LVSI is present but not sampled)
- **Orange-peeling**: Inadequate sampling misses NODES, not metastases

This suggests:
- For disease DETECTION (omentum, LVSI): More sampling → better detection
- For node ADEQUACY (LN): Better technique → more nodes, same metastases

### Goess et al. (2024) - LN Yield in Endometrial Cancer

| Feature | Orange-peeling PDAC | Goess Endometrial |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Tissue** | Pancreatic LN | Pelvic/para-aortic LN |
| **Comparison** | Orange-peeling vs conventional | Above vs below median LN yield |
| **Median LN** | 23 vs 16 | Median used as cutoff |
| **Stage migration** | None | Yes (higher yield → more N+ found) |
| **Method** | Hypergeometric | Binomial probability |
| **Conclusion** | Technique matters for adequacy | Yield matters for detection |

**Key Difference**: Goess found stage migration, orange-peeling did NOT.

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Pancreatic LN are more obvious** (surgeon identifies them during dissection)
2. **Endometrial LN are smaller/harder to find** (more affected by pathologist effort)
3. **Orange-peeling is technique**, Goess comparison is effort/experience
4. **Different cancer biology** (PDAC metastasizes differently)

### Habib et al. (2024) - IPMN LN

| Feature | Orange-peeling PDAC | Habib IPMN |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **Tissue** | Pancreatic LN (PDAC) | Pancreatic LN (IPMN) |
| **Threshold** | ≥12 LN (NCCN guideline) | Dual threshold (8 & 15 LN) |
| **Method** | Hypergeometric | Maximally selected log-rank |
| **Survival impact** | Not analyzed | Yes (LN yield predicts survival) |
| **Stage migration** | None | Not analyzed |

**Similarity**: Both pancreatic cancer LN analyses
**Difference**: Habib focused on survival; orange-peeling on adequacy

---

### Skala & Hagemann (2015) - Omentum Sampling

| Feature | Orange-peeling PDAC | Skala Omentum |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Tissue** | Pancreatic LN | Omentum |
| **Question** | How to improve LN yield? | How many cassettes for detection? |
| **Method** | Hypergeometric | Bootstrap + binomial |
| **Optimal number** | 17-18 LN (95% for N2) | 4 cassettes (95% detection) |
| **Right-censored data** | N/A (all LN examined) | Yes (cassettes after detection) |
| **Key finding** | Technique matters | Sampling adequacy guideline |

**Similarity**: Both determine adequacy thresholds
**Difference**: Omentum is detection problem; LN is yield problem

## Implications for Our Pathsampling Implementation

### Current Pathsampling Capabilities

Our pathsampling jamovi function currently implements:

1. ✅ **Binomial probability model**
   - P(detect ≥1) = 1 - (1-p)^n
   - Estimates p from first detection data
   - Suitable for omentum/LVSI (large/infinite populations)

2. ✅ **Bootstrap resampling**
   - Empirical sensitivity estimates
   - 95% confidence intervals
   - Handles right-censored data

3. ✅ **Distribution pattern analysis** (Ates 2025)
   - Single vs summed classification
   - Tumor burden quantification

4. ✅ **Stage migration analysis**
   - Detection rates by sampling intensity
   - Goess methodology

5. ❌ **Hypergeometric model** - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

---

### What the Orange-Peeling Study Adds

**NEW Methodological Approach**: Hypergeometric probability model

**Use Case**: Finite population sampling (lymph nodes, fixed number of cassettes)

**Required Inputs**:
- **N**: Total population size (e.g., total LN in specimen)
- **K**: Success states (e.g., metastatic LN)
- **n**: Samples examined (what we control)
- **k**: Desired detections (e.g., ≥1 for N1, ≥4 for N2)

**Output**: Minimum n required for X% confidence of detecting ≥k positives

---

### Implementation Strategy

**Option 1: Add Hypergeometric Model to Existing Pathsampling**

Pros:
- All methods in one analysis
- Users can compare binomial vs hypergeometric
- Consistent interface

Cons:
- Different data requirements (binomial needs first detection; hypergeometric needs N and K)
- May confuse users about which method to use
- Could make interface cluttered

**Option 2: Create Separate "LN Adequacy Analysis" Function**

Pros:
- Focused on LN dissection use case
- Clear separation from omentum/LVSI analysis
- Can include LN-specific outputs (stage, LN ratio, adequacy %)

Cons:
- Code duplication
- Requires new function development
- More maintenance

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Option 1** - Add hypergeometric as optional model in pathsampling

Rationale:
- Mathematical similarity (both probability models)
- Users doing omentum analysis may also want LN analysis
- Can enable/disable via checkbox: "Use hypergeometric model (for finite populations)"

---

### Data Requirements for Hypergeometric Analysis

**Input Variables Required**:

1. **Total LN examined** (per case) - Already have (totalSamples equivalent)
2. **Metastatic LN found** (per case) - NEW variable needed
3. **Stage classification** (N0/N1/N2) - Optional, for validation

**Optional Enhancements**:

4. **Dissection technique** (e.g., orange-peeling vs conventional) - Grouping variable
5. **Specimen type** (e.g., Whipple, distal pancreatectomy) - Stratification variable

**Data Structure Example**:

| Case | Total_LN | Met_LN | Stage | Technique |
|------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1    | 23       | 2      | N1    | OP        |
| 2    | 16       | 0      | N0    | CONV      |
| 3    | 24       | 5      | N2    | OP        |
| 4    | 12       | 1      | N1    | CONV      |

## Translation to Omentum Analysis

### Does Orange-Peeling Methodology Apply to Omentum?

**Similarities**:
- Both are adequacy questions
- Both involve sampling from specimens
- Both have guideline thresholds (LN: ≥12, Omentum: 4 cassettes per Skala)

**Differences**:

| Feature | Pancreatic LN | Omentum |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Population** | Finite, discrete (N=16-24 nodes) | Continuous tissue area |
| **Sampling** | Without replacement (exhaust pool) | With replacement (many possible cassettes) |
| **Best model** | Hypergeometric | Binomial |
| **Detection** | Find nodes surgeon missed? | Find metastasis in large tissue |
| **Technique impact** | Orange-peeling finds more nodes | Sectioning finds more metastases? |

**CONCLUSION**: Omentum should continue using **binomial model**, NOT hypergeometric.

**HOWEVER**: The **distribution pattern analysis** (Ates 2025) IS applicable to omentum!

---

### Omentum Analysis: No Changes Needed to Statistical Model

The binomial model remains appropriate for omentum because:

1. **Large/infinite population**: Omentum is a large tissue area with many potential sampling locations
2. **Rare event**: Metastasis is relatively rare in any given cassette
3. **Sampling with replacement**: Each cassette is a random sample from a large tissue area
4. **Right-censored data**: Cassettes after first detection are not examined (binomial handles this)

**The hypergeometric model would be inappropriate because**:
- Omentum doesn't have a fixed "total number of metastatic foci" (like LN has total nodes)
- Sampling cassettes doesn't "exhaust" the omentum (unlike examining all LN)
- n/N ratio is tiny (4 cassettes / hundreds of possible cassette locations)

---

### What the Orange-Peeling Study DOES Teach Us About Omentum

**Lesson 1: Technique vs Sampling Intensity**

- **Orange-peeling**: Better TECHNIQUE → more LN yield, same metastases
- **Omentum**: More CASSETTES → better metastasis detection

**Implication**: For omentum, the equivalent of "orange-peeling" would be:
- Gross examination technique (thorough palpation, bread-loafing)
- Strategic cassette selection (target suspicious areas)
- Adequate initial sampling (≥4 cassettes per Skala)

**Lesson 2: Adequacy vs Stage Migration**

- **Orange-peeling**: Improved adequacy WITHOUT stage migration
- **Omentum**: Should aim for adequacy (95% detection) without over-sampling

**Implication**: 4 cassettes is the "sweet spot" for omentum:
- Achieves 95% detection (adequate)
- Doesn't require excessive sampling
- Parallels ≥12 LN criterion (evidence-based threshold)

**Lesson 3: Effect Size Reporting**

- **Orange-peeling study**: Reported Cliff's delta, Hodges-Lehmann shift, OR, RR, RD
- **Our omentum analysis**: Could add these effect size measures

**Implication**: Enhance pathsampling output with:
- Cliff's delta for non-parametric comparisons
- Hodges-Lehmann median difference
- OR/RR/RD for adequacy achievement rates

## Recommendations for Pathsampling Enhancement

### Priority 1: Add Hypergeometric Model (For LN Analysis)

**Implementation**:

1. **Add new option in pathsampling.a.yaml**:
```yaml
- name: modelType
  title: Probability model
  type: List
  options:
    - name: binomial
      title: Binomial (infinite population, with replacement)
    - name: hypergeometric
      title: Hypergeometric (finite population, without replacement)
  default: binomial

- name: totalPopulation
  title: Total population size (for hypergeometric model)
  type: Variable
  suggested:
    - continuous
  permitted:
    - numeric

- name: successStates
  title: Success states in population (for hypergeometric model)
  type: Variable
  suggested:
    - continuous
  permitted:
    - numeric

- name: targetDetections
  title: Minimum detections desired (e.g., 1 for N1, 4 for N2)
  type: Integer
  min: 1
  default: 1
```

2. **Add hypergeometric calculations in pathsampling.b.R**:
```r
# Hypergeometric model
if (self$options$modelType == 'hypergeometric') {
    # Get population parameters
    N <- mean(totalPopulationData, na.rm = TRUE)  # Total LN
    K <- mean(successStatesData, na.rm = TRUE)    # Metastatic LN
    target <- self$options$targetDetections        # e.g., 1 or 4

    # Calculate P(detect >= target) for n = 1 to maxSamples
    for (n in 1:maxSamples) {
        # P(X >= target) = 1 - P(X < target)
        prob <- 1 - phyper(target - 1, K, N - K, n)

        # Store in table
        hyperTable$setRow(rowNo=n, values=list(
            nSamples = n,
            cumProb = prob,
            marginalGain = prob - prev_prob
        ))
        prev_prob <- prob
    }

    # Find minimum n for target confidence
    minSamples <- min(which(probs >= self$options$targetConfidence))
}
```

3. **Add output tables in pathsampling.r.yaml**:
```yaml
- name: hypergeometricTable
  title: Hypergeometric Model Predictions
  type: Table
  visible: (modelType:hypergeometric)
  columns:
    - name: nSamples
      title: 'Number of Samples'
      type: integer
    - name: cumProb
      title: 'P(detect ≥k)'
      type: number
      format: 'pc'
    - name: marginalGain
      title: 'Marginal Gain'
      type: number
      format: 'pc'
```

---

### Priority 2: Add Effect Size Measures

**Add to existing analyses**:

1. **Cliff's Delta** (for non-parametric comparisons)
```r
# Calculate Cliff's delta
cliff_delta <- function(x, y) {
    n1 <- length(x)
    n2 <- length(y)

    # Count concordant and discordant pairs
    concordant <- sum(outer(x, y, ">"))
    discordant <- sum(outer(x, y, "<"))

    delta <- (concordant - discordant) / (n1 * n2)
    return(delta)
}

# Interpretation
# |δ| < 0.147: negligible
# |δ| < 0.330: small
# |δ| < 0.474: medium
# |δ| ≥ 0.474: large
```

2. **Hodges-Lehmann Estimator** (median difference)
```r
# All pairwise differences
hodges_lehmann <- function(x, y) {
    diffs <- outer(x, y, "-")
    median(diffs)
}
```

3. **Add to stage migration analysis**:
```r

### Priority 3: Add LN-Specific Analysis Features

**New analysis section**: "Lymph Node Staging Analysis"

**Required variables**:
- Total LN examined
- Metastatic LN found
- Stage (N0/N1/N2) - optional

**Outputs**:

1. **LN Ratio Statistics**:
```
Measure                          | Value
---------------------------------|-------
Median LN ratio                  | 0.157
Mean LN ratio                    | 0.213
LN ratio range                   | 0.00 - 0.85
```

2. **Stage Distribution**:
```
Stage | Cases | Percentage | Mean Total LN | Mean Met LN
------|-------|------------|---------------|------------
N0    | 68    | 33.0%      | 22.3          | 0.0
N1    | 64    | 31.2%      | 23.1          | 2.1
N2    | 73    | 35.7%      | 24.8          | 6.3
```

3. **Adequacy by Stage**:
```
Stage | <12 LN  | ≥12 LN  | Adequacy %
------|---------|---------|------------
N0    | 8       | 60      | 88.2%
N1    | 5       | 59      | 92.2%
N2    | 4       | 69      | 94.5%
```

   - Choosing the right approach

---

## Clinical Practice Guidelines

### For Pathologists

**Pancreatic LN Dissection**:

1. **Technique Matters**:
   - Consider orange-peeling technique for Whipple specimens
   - Achieves 91.9% adequacy (vs 77.0% conventional)
   - Yields +6 additional LN on average

2. **Adequacy Threshold**:
   - NCCN guideline: ≥12 LN
   - Hypergeometric analysis: 12 LN achieves ~87% confidence for ≥1 detection
   - For N2 detection (≥4 met LN): aim for 17-18 LN (95% confidence)

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Monitor adequacy achievement rate (target: >85%)
   - Track mean LN yield by technique
   - Standardize technique across institution

**Reporting Template**:
```
LYMPH NODE EXAMINATION

Total lymph nodes examined: [XX]
Metastatic lymph nodes identified: [XX]
Lymph node ratio: [XX.XX]

Adequacy: [✓] Adequate (≥12 LN) / [ ] Limited (<12 LN)

pN Stage: [ ] N0 (0 metastatic LN)
          [ ] N1 (1-3 metastatic LN)
          [ ] N2 (≥4 metastatic LN)

Dissection technique: [ ] Orange-peeling [ ] Conventional

Comment: Hypergeometric analysis indicates 95% confidence for N2
detection requires ≥18 lymph nodes examined.
```

### For Surgeons

**Lymph Node Dissection**:

1. **Submit Adequate Tissue**:
   - Ensure comprehensive LN dissection during Whipple
   - Label LN stations clearly (pancreatic head, body, tail, peripancreatic, etc.)
   - Aim for ≥15-18 LN for optimal staging

2. **Communication with Pathology**:
   - Request orange-peeling technique if available
   - Discuss cases with <12 LN (limited dissection vs difficult anatomy)

---

### For Oncologists

**Interpreting LN Reports**:

1. **Adequacy Assessment**:
   - <12 LN: May be understaged (use clinical judgment)
   - ≥12 LN: Adequate for N1 detection
   - ≥18 LN: Adequate for N2 detection (95% confidence)

2. **LN Ratio Caveat**:
   - LN ratio may vary with dissection technique
   - Compare LN ratios only within same technique (OP vs OP, CONV vs CONV)
   - Consider absolute met LN count in addition to ratio

3. **Treatment Decisions**:
   - Inadequate LN sampling: Consider adjuvant therapy even if pN0
   - Stage migration risk: Higher with <10 LN examined

---

## Research Opportunities

### Immediate (Retrospective Analysis)

1. **Validate Hypergeometric Model in Other Tissues**:
   - Apply to our omentum data (if we have total LN equivalent)
   - Test in endometrial LN dissection
   - Compare binomial vs hypergeometric predictions

2. **Orange-Peeling Technique Adoption Study**:
   - Before/after analysis at institution implementing OP
   - LN yield, adequacy, stage distribution
   - Cost-effectiveness (time vs benefit)

---

### Short-Term (Prospective Collection)

1. **Optimal LN Threshold Validation**:
   - Is 12 LN optimal, or should it be 15 or 18?
   - Survival analysis by LN yield groups
   - ROC analysis for different thresholds

2. **Technique Standardization**:
   - Randomized trial: OP vs conventional
   - Multi-institutional validation
   - Training program for orange-peeling

3. **Distribution Pattern in LN**:
   - Apply Ates "single vs summed" concept to LN
   - Does concentration of metastases in 1-2 nodes predict worse survival?
   - LN ratio alone may miss this spatial information

---

### Long-Term (Multi-Institutional)

1. **Integrated Staging Model**:
   - Combine LN count, LN ratio, distribution pattern, stage
   - Develop prognostic nomogram
   - Personalized treatment algorithms

2. **Cross-Tissue Meta-Analysis**:
   - Omentum (4 cassettes), LVSI (7 blocks), LN (12 nodes)
   - Universal adequacy principles
   - Tissue-specific optimization

---

## Key Takeaways

### Methodological Insights

1. **Hypergeometric > Binomial for Finite Populations**:
   - Use hypergeometric when sampling fraction (n/N) > 10%
   - LN dissection: finite pool, sampling exhausts population
   - Omentum/LVSI: infinite population, binomial still appropriate

2. **Technique vs Intensity**:
   - Orange-peeling: Better TECHNIQUE → more yield
   - More cassettes/blocks: Greater INTENSITY → better detection
   - Both improve quality, different mechanisms

3. **Adequacy ≠ Stage Migration**:
   - Orange-peeling improved adequacy WITHOUT stage migration
   - This is GOOD (quality improvement without stage inflation)
   - Contrast with Ates/Goess where sampling DID cause migration

4. **Effect Size Matters**:
   - p-values alone insufficient
   - Cliff's delta, Hodges-Lehmann shift, OR/RR/RD provide clinical context
   - Medium-large effects (δ = 0.424) are clinically meaningful

---

### Implementation Insights

1. **Add Hypergeometric to Pathsampling** ✅ Recommended
   - Enable LN dissection analysis use case
   - Keep binomial for omentum/LVSI
   - User selects model type based on tissue/question

2. **Enhance Effect Size Reporting** ✅ Recommended
   - Add Cliff's delta for group comparisons
   - Add OR/RR/RD for adequacy tables
   - More informative than p-values alone

3. **Keep Omentum Analysis Unchanged** ✅ Correct
   - Binomial model remains appropriate
   - Distribution pattern analysis (Ates) still applicable
   - No methodological changes needed

4. **Create LN-Specific Features** ⭐ Future enhancement
   - LN ratio calculations
   - Stage distribution tables
   - Adequacy by stage analysis

---

### Clinical Insights

1. **For Pancreatic LN**:
   - Orange-peeling recommended (3.4× better adequacy)
   - Aim for ≥18 LN (95% confidence for N2)
   - No stage migration risk

2. **For Omentum**:
   - 4 cassettes remain evidence-based guideline
   - Focus on technique (thorough gross examination)
   - Distribution pattern analysis when applicable

3. **For LVSI**:
   - 7 blocks optimal (Ates 2025)
   - ≥5 foci threshold validated
   - Single vs summed matters for prognosis

4. **Universal Principle**:
   - Evidence-based adequacy thresholds (4, 7, 12, 18)
   - Technique AND intensity both matter
   - Effect sizes guide clinical significance

---

## Conclusions

The orange-peeling pancreatic LN study provides:

1. ✅ **NEW methodology**: Hypergeometric probability model for finite population sampling
2. ✅ **Validation**: Adequacy thresholds (≥12 for N1, ≥18 for N2) evidence-based
3. ✅ **Quality improvement**: Orange-peeling dramatically improves adequacy without stage inflation
4. ✅ **Implementation path**: Add hypergeometric option to pathsampling for LN analysis

**Next Steps**:

1. Implement hypergeometric model in pathsampling.b.R
2. Add effect size measures (Cliff's delta, Hodges-Lehmann, OR/RR/RD)
3. Create LN-specific analysis features
4. Develop documentation and vignettes
5. Test with pancreatic LN dataset

**Impact**: This enhancement will make pathsampling the **only jamovi module** (and one of the few R packages) to offer integrated binomial + hypergeometric sampling adequacy analysis with distribution pattern assessment across multiple tissue types.
