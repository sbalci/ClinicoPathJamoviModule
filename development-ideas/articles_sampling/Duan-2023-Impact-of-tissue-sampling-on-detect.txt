Impact of tissue sampling on detection of venous invasion in colorectal cancer: a prospective analysis
Aims: Venous invasion (VI) is a powerful yet underreported prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC).
Efforts to improve its detection have largely focused upon
histological assessment, with less attention paid to
tissue-sampling strategies. This study aimed to prospectively determine the number of tumour blocks required
to optimise VI detection in CRC resections. In addition,
the relationship between linear spiculation (LS) and
extramural venous invasion (EMVI) was investigated.
Methods and results: A standardised tissue sampling
protocol was developed and applied prospectively to
217 CRC resections [AJCC 8th edition, stage 1
(n = 32); stage 2 (n = 84); stage 3 (n = 87); stage 4
(n = 14); and post-neoadjuvant therapy (n = 46)].
Elastin stains were performed on all tumour blocks. VI
was identified in 55% of cases (EMVI = 37%; IMVI
alone = 18%). The sensitivity of VI detection increased

with increasing numbers of tumour blocks submitted [one block (35%), three blocks (66%), five blocks
(84%), six blocks (95%) and seven blocks (97%)].
Similar findings were observed for EMVI [one block
(35%), three blocks (73%), five blocks (89%), six
blocks (96%) and seven blocks (96%)]. LS was identified macroscopically in 22% of specimens. In cases
where no neoadjuvant therapy had been given,
EMVI was significantly associated with LS (71% in
LS+ cases versus 29% in LS– cases; P < 0.001). In
addition, tumour blocks targeting LS were associated with a fivefold higher rate of EMVI compared
with blocks that did not (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the impact of
tissue sampling and quality of gross examination on
VI detection and may inform practices in future CRC
protocols.

Introduction
Venous invasion (VI) is a powerful predictor of haematogenous spread and mortality in colorectal cancer
(CRC).1–14 This is particularly true for extramural

venous invasion (EMVI); prognostic significance of
intramural venous invasion (IMVI) alone has been
suggested, but is less well-established.2–4,10,12,13,15,16
The accurate detection of VI is especially relevant in
stage II CRC, where its presence may influence adjuvant treatment decisions. Despite its prognostic
importance, the assessment of VI remains one of the
most poorly performed aspects of CRC pathology.
Population-based studies suggest that VI is underreported in CRC,17,18 with wide variation in VI

detection rates among published studies.19 Such variation may be multifactorial and probably reflects differences in case mix, tissue sampling techniques,
diagnostic thresholds, use of ancillary stains and the
diligence and skill of the reporting pathologist.19 VI
can be challenging to assess on a routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and is therefore easily overlooked, especially when tumour distorts, effaces or
obliterates involved vessels. Elastin stains (which
highlight residual elastic fibres of the vein wall) have
been shown to be remarkably effective in facilitating
VI detection in this setting.20 In addition, there is
growing evidence that elastin stains not only improve
the detection of VI, but also enhance its ability to
stratify risk in CRC.11,21–23 Several international CRC
pathology protocols/guidelines now recognise the utility of elastin stains in facilitating VI detection.24–28
To date, most efforts to improve VI detection have
focused upon histological assessment, including the
recognition of key morphological clues (e.g.
‘orphaned artery’ and ‘protruding tongue’ signs) and
the role of elastin stains.11,19,20,29 Less attention has
been paid to tissue sampling strategies, with the
result that there are currently no evidence-based
guidelines specifying the number of tumourcontaining blocks that should be submitted to optimise VI detection. While some retrospective studies
have reported an association between VI detection
rates and the number of tumour-containing blocks
submitted,10,30 prospective studies using standardised
tissue sampling protocols are lacking. Thus, the number of tumour blocks that should be submitted to
optimise VI detection remains to be determined. In
addition to these quantitative considerations, there
are also qualitative issues relating to tissue sampling
for VI detection that remain to be resolved. For example, some have proposed the use of tangential sectioning along the radial border of the tumour to enhance
VI detection by increasing the likelihood of capturing
veins that pass at right angles across the bowel wall
and into mesocolic tissues.30–32 It has been suggested
that this allows for the transverse sectioning of multiple vessels, as opposed to longitudinal sections of individual vessels associated with the conventional
perpendicular sampling approach.31 However, others
point out that tangential sectioning may compromise
the assessment of other key aspects of the pathology
assessment, such as assessment of tumour depth,
tumour deposits and tumour budding.33 It has also
been suggested that a more targeted approach to tissue sampling may enhance VI detection. In particular, areas of linear spiculation (LS), defined as fine
pale lines emanating from the base of the tumour

generally perpendicular to the infiltrating edge, are
considered a possible clue to the presence of EMVI.
For this reason, the Royal College of Pathologists of
the United Kingdom (RCPathUK) recommends sampling areas of LS at the advancing edge of the
tumour,26 a practice also favoured by others.19,34
Despite such guidance, the relationship between LS
and EMVI remains to be studied prospectively.
In this prospective study we developed a standardised tissue sampling protocol to evaluate the impact
of tissue sampling on VI detection. Specifically, we
aimed to determine the number of tissue blocks
required to optimise VI detection and to evaluate the
relationship between LS and EMVI in order to inform
future sampling practices.

Material and methods
STUDY COHORT

A search of our laboratory information system identified all consecutive patients who underwent radical
surgical resection of CRC at Mount Sinai Hospital,
Toronto, Canada, between 1 November 2016 and
30 June 2019 (n = 244). Cases were excluded if complete archival material was not available (n = 12), if
there was no residual tumour in the specimen (either
post-chemoradiation or post-polypectomy) (n = nine)
or if the standardised grossing protocol had not been
applied (n = six). Following these exclusions, a total
of 217 stage I–IV CRC resections were included in
this study. This study was approved by our institutional Research Ethics Board.
STANDARDISED TISSUE SAMPLING PROTOCOL

A standardised tissue sampling protocol was developed and applied prospectively to all CRC resection
specimens (Figure 1). This included submission of a
minimum of eight tumour-containing blocks for histological examination (tumour size permitting), with
smaller tumours submitted in their entirety. Each
tumour was perpendicularly sectioned and submitted
in a consistent order starting from the point of deepest invasion and moving proximally and distally in a
stepwise fashion, with the resulting tumour blocks
designated 1–8. All specimens were inspected for evidence of LS at the advancing edge of the tumour
(Figure 2). All foci of LS were incorporated in the
submitted tumour blocks and the presence or absence
of LS was documented in the gross description section
of the pathology report. Elastin trichrome stains were
performed on all tumour blocks (Figure 3).

Figure 1. A standardised tumour mapping and sampling protocol was developed for this study and applied prospectively to CRC resections
from a single institution. Each tumour was perpendicularly sectioned and submitted starting from the point of deepest invasion and moving
proximally and distally in a stepwise fashion. A minimum of eight tumour-containing blocks were submitted for histological examination.
Tumours that could be submitted in fewer than eight blocks were submitted in their entirety.

Figure 2. Careful gross inspection was performed for areas of linear spiculation (LS) (at the advancing edge of the tumour), and such areas
were targeted when submitting blocks and documented in the gross description. LS, defined macroscopically as fine pale lines emanating
from the base of the tumour and generally perpendicular to the infiltrating edge, has been suggested to be a marker of EMVI. As such, some
guidelines recommend targeting areas of LS to optimise VI detection, although the association between LS and VI has not been studied systematically prior to the current study.

CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL DATA

Pathology reports were reviewed to confirm that the
standardised tissue sampling protocol was followed
and to document patient demographics, the presence/
absence of LS and histopathological data elements
included the College of American Pathologists CRC
checklist. In addition, all cases underwent a re-review
for VI using both H&E and corresponding elastin trichrome stains (K.D.). The presence or absence of VI
was documented for each individual tumour block.
The location of VI (i.e. EMVI versus IMVI) was

also documented. The number of tumour-containing
blocks submitted and the number of elastin stains
performed were recorded for each case.
DETERMINING THE SENSITIVITY OF VI DETECTION

Based on the assumption that histological examination of eight tumour-containing blocks would identify
100% of VI-positive cases, we determined the sensitivity of VI detection for each incremental number of
submitted blocks (1–8). To illustrate, for determining
the sensitivity of VI detection associated with

not. Forty-eight cases were right-sided, 85 left-sided
and 84 rectal in location. The mean tumour size was
4.9 cm (median = 4.3 cm, range = 0.5–13.7 cm).
An average of 7.3 tumour-containing blocks were
submitted from each specimen and stained with elastin trichrome (this number falls below the eight
blocks specified in the tissue sampling protocol, owing
to a small minority of tumours that were entirely
submitted in fewer than eight blocks). The cohort
characteristics and relationship with VI and EMVI
status are summarised in Table 1. Both VI and
EMVI were significantly associated with T-stage, Nstage, AJCC stage, tumour deposits, perineural invasion and resection margin status. In addition, EMVI
(but not VI) was significantly associated with tumour
size ≥ 5.0 cm, tumour grade and number of tumour
blocks stained with an elastin stain.
VI DETECTION AND ASSOCIATION WITH
SUBMITTED TUMOUR BLOCKS

Overall, VI and EMVI were detected in 55 and 37% of
cases, respectively. In stage 2 cancers (n = 84), the
rates of VI and EMVI were 44 and 26%. There was a
stepwise increase in the sensitivity of VI and EMVI
detection with the increasing numbers of tumour
blocks examined histologically (VI = 35% for one
block, 66% for three blocks, 84% for five blocks, 95%
for six blocks and 97% for seven blocks; EMVI = 35%
for one block, 73% for three blocks, 89% for five
blocks and 96% for six and seven blocks; Figure 4.A,
B). Similar trends were observed when the
analysis was restricted to tumours ≥ 5.0 cm in maximum dimension (n = 84) (Figure 5A,B), tumours
< 5.0 cm in maximum dimension (n = 133)
(Figure 5C,D), stage 2 CRC (n = 84) (Figure 5E,F) and
patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy (n = 171)
(Figure 5G,H).
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LS AND EMVI

LS was identified macroscopically in 47 CRC resections (22%). In tumours that were not treated with
neoadjuvant chemoradiation (n = 171), EMVI was
identified in 71% of tumours with LS compared to
29% of tumours without (P < 0.001). Moreover,
tumour blocks targeting LS were five times more
likely to show EMVI than those without LS
(P < 0.001). However, among cases with EMVI
detected histologically, only 39% showed LS, while
only 31% of blocks targeting LS were found to have
EMVI on corresponding slides. There was no significant association between LS and EMVI in the post-

5

neoadjuvant group (P > 0.95), although this analysis
was limited by small sample size (n = 46).

Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate
the impact of tissue sampling on VI detection using a
prospectively designed tissue-sampling protocol. We
found that histological examination of six
standard-sized tumour-containing blocks in CRC
resection specimens identified approximately 95% of
VI- and EMVI-positive cases, while histological examination of fewer than six blocks resulted in significant
numbers of cases being missed. For example, when
only five tumour blocks were examined histologically,
16% of VI-positive and 11% of EMVI-positive cases
were missed, while when only four tumour
blocks were examined histologically, 24% of VIpositive and 20% of EMVI-positive cases were missed.
Based on these findings, we believe that a minimum
of six tumour-containing blocks should be submitted
for optimal histological assessment of VI and EMVI.
Of note, the blocks used in our study were standardsized (3.0 9 2.5 cm). The study design did not permit
assessment of an optimal number for other sizes,
including ‘macro’ or ‘mega’ blocks used in some
centres.
VI (especially EMVI) is among the most powerful
prognostic factors in CRC, rivalling lymph node
status.6,12–14,35 Therefore, strategies to ensure its
accurate assessment are critical. Such strategies have
largely focused upon histological aspects of VI assessment, including recognition of morphological clues
and the use of elastin stains. Tissue sampling strategies are less well studied. Adequate tissue sampling is
critical, as even the most meticulous histological
assessment will not identify a VI focus that is missed
due to undersampling. Limited retrospective data
point to an association between the number
of tumour blocks examined histologically and the rate
of VI detection.10,30 However, prospective studies
designed to determine the minimum number of
tumour blocks required to optimise VI detection are
lacking. In a large retrospective series of rectal cancers, Talbot et al. reported that 3.9% of EMVI-positive
cases would be missed if five tumour blocks were submitted, 10.6% if four tumour blocks were submitted,
22.8% if three tumour blocks were submitted and
41.3% if only two were submitted.30 However, their
data were calculated retrospectively by a combinatorial analysis of the number of blocks examined in
each case broken down according to the number of

Impact of tissue sampling on venous invasion detection in CRC

histologically (35% for one block, 66% for three blocks, 84% for five blocks, 95% for six blocks and 97% for seven blocks). B, Similar findings

slides harbouring EMVI in each case, rather than on
direct experimental evidence. In a retrospective study
of 381 CRC, Betge et al. found a positive association
between the number of tumour blocks submitted and
the rate of VI detection.10 The VI detection rate was
12% in tumours with three or fewer blocks submitted, 24% in tumours with four to six blocks
submitted and 48% in tumours with seven or more
blocks submitted. The authors concluded that submission of three to five blocks (which had been recommended in some earlier CRC protocols) was probably
insufficient for the detection of VI. However, they
cautioned that their cohort was unsuitable for a

definitive recommendation, given the retrospective
design of their study, and emphasised the need for
future prospective studies to define the number of tissue blocks that should be examined for the optimum
detection of VI.10
In the absence of prospective data there remain no
evidence-based guidelines for tumour block submission to optimise VI detection. Current recommendations rely largely upon expert opinion. The data set
for histological reporting of CRC reporting of
RCPathUK recommends submission of at least five
tumour blocks (or more for large tumours), size permitting, to allow for histological assessment of deepest

Figure 5. Subgroup analyses revealed similar trends to the full cohort, including when the analysis was restricted to tumours > 5.0 cm in
maximum dimension (n = 84) (A,B), tumours < 5.0 in maximum dimension (n = 133) (C,D), stage 2 CRC (n = 84) (E,F) and patients not
receiving neoadjuvant therapy (n = 171) (G,H).

Impact of tissue sampling on venous invasion detection in CRC

penetration through the bowel wall, involvement of
the peritoneal surface and VI and involvement
of adjacent organs, as well as ancillary immunohistochemical and/or molecular tests.26 The CRC structured reporting protocol of the Royal College of
Pathologists of Australasia notes that it is not possible
to provide an absolute number for tumour blocks that
should be routinely examined in CRC resections.
Rather, it is recommended that sufficient blocks (generally at least four) should be taken to enable the
pathologist to fully assess all the necessary parameters for staging and prognosis.28 Neither the College
of American Pathologists CRC protocol nor the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting CRC data
set refer to minimum number of blocks that
should be routinely examined in CRC resection
specimens.24,25
In addition to providing important prognostic information, the finding of VI (and particularly EMVI)
may prompt oncologists to consider adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage 2 CRC. Therefore,
missing VI (whether at the tissue sampling or histological assessment stage) may have significant clinical
implications. We and others have shown that VI/
EMVI-positive cases missed at the time of original
pathology assessment but detected on subsequent
review have similar adverse outcomes to VI/EMVIpositive cases that were originally detected.23,36 In
addition, Betge et al. found that VI assessed by expert
review had a much stronger association with oncological outcomes than VI assessed in the routine setting due, at least in part, to missed VI-positive
cases.10 While such misses occurred at the histological level, there is no reason to believe that VI missed
due to insufficient sampling carries any less prognostic significance. As such, adequate tissue sampling
merits the same attention as accurate histological
assessment towards the goal of optimising VI
detection.
Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate
the relationship between the macroscopic finding of
LS and the histological finding of EMVI. The
RCPathUK CRC data set suggests that LS may be a
macroscopic marker of EMVI and recommends targeted sampling of such areas,26 a view shared by
others.19,34 This recommendation appears to be
largely based upon expert opinion and experience
because, to our knowledge, the relationship between
LS and EMVI has not been formally studied. We
found a positive association between LS and EMVI in
patients in the non-neoadjuvant-treated group, with
LS-positive specimens showing significantly higher
rates of EMVI than LS-negative counterparts

(71 versus 29%, respectively). No such association
was observed in the neoadjuvant-treated group, possibly due to treatment-associated changes that might
obscure or mimic LS, although small sample size
probably also contributed. While the rate of EMVI
was higher in targeted (LS-positive) than in nontargeted (LS-negative) tumour blocks, most LSpositive blocks did not show EMVI histologically. In
addition, the sensitivity of LS for EMVI was only
39%, indicating that its absence does not exclude
EMVI. Taken together, our findings provide support
for the sampling of LS. On the whole, sampling areas
with LS provides a higher yield for EMVI detection
than sections without LS, although this effect is modest and LS is neither sensitive nor specific for EMVI
detection.
The main strength of our study is that the impact
of specimen-handling has been demonstrated prospectively in a ‘real world’ pathology practice setting.
Indeed, the prospective nature of our study allowed
us to carefully design and apply a standardised protocol for both macroscopic and microscopic assessment
of VI in a cohort of consecutive CRC resections. This
permitted us to adjust for confounding variables, particularly those during specimen-handling and tissue
sampling, that would not have been possible in a retrospective study. Data were also collected consecutively, limiting the potential for selection bias.
Elastin trichrome stains were used together with
H&E to facilitate the assessment of VI in this study.
This allowed us to determine with a high level of confidence whether VI was present or absent in each individual tissue block. Numerous studies have shown that
VI is frequently missed when evaluated on H&E stains
alone, with VI detection rates increasing by at least
twofold when an elastin stain is used.11,19–23,29,37–40
More importantly, several studies have shown that VI
assessed with an elastin stain is associated with superior risk stratification in CRC compared to VI assessed
on H&E alone.11,21–23 This is probably due to the large
number of VI-positive cases that are missed on H&E
and consequently categorised as ‘VI-negative’, with
the effect that overall outcomes appear worse in that
group. Although our study does not provide data on
the minimum number of tumour blocks required to
‘optimise’ VI detection based on H&E alone, we believe
that the number would probably be higher than the
minimum number of six blocks proposed in this study.
This is because the sensitivity of VI detection by H&E is
lower than with an elastin stain, so that more blocks
would probably need to be examined to identify a VIpositive case. Irrespective of the stain used, our data
suggest that submission of four to five tumour blocks is

probably insufficient for the sensitive detection of VI
and that, at a minimum, six tumour blocks should be
submitted (tumour size permitting). The benefit of elastin stains to optimise VI is well documented and
acknowledged in leading CRC protocols, although
time restraints and resource limitations may affect
individual decisions as to whether these stains are used
routinely. Where cost considerations are an issue, the
use of an elastin trichrome as an alternative to H&E
might be feasible. In a recent study, elastin trichrome
performed similarly to H&E in the assessment of College of American Pathologists mandated histological
features, while outperforming H&E with respect to VI
detection.41
In summary, we believe that is the first study to
evaluate the impact of specimen-handling techniques
on the detection of VI in a prospective manner. Our
findings suggest that a minimum of six tumour containing blocks should be submitted to optimise VI
detection and that targeted sampling of areas of LS
may be of value. Our findings may inform sampling
practices in future CRC protocols.
