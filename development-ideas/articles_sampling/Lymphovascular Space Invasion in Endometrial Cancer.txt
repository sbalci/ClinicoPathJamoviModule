Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is a key prognostic factor in endometrial cancer, guiding
adjuvant treatment decisions. This retrospective study analyzed 208 hysterectomy specimens with
conﬁrmed  LVSI to determine optimal sampling strategies for detecting substantial LVSI. Samples/
blocks from tumor inﬁltration  fronts were reviewed microscopically, and LVSI foci were counted
per slide and summed across all slides. Cutoffs of ≥5, ≥4, and ≥3 LVSI foci were evaluated. Only the
≥5 threshold signiﬁcantly  correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = .038) compared with <5
LVSI. Both patients with ≥5 LVSI foci either on a single slide or those reaching this threshold by
summing across slides were associated with nodal metastasis (P = .023). However, signiﬁcantly 
worse overall survival was observed only in patients with ≥5 foci on a single slide, not in those
reaching the threshold by summing across multiple slides (P < .001). Focal LVSI (<5 foci) showed no
signiﬁcant  overall survival compared with substantial LVSI. Increased sampling from the tumor
inﬁltration  front improved LVSI detection rates (P < .001), but gains in detecting substantial LVSI
plateaued after 7 samples/blocks. Higher LVSI levels were associated with deep LVSI and cervical/
endocervical LVSI (P < .001). Deep LVSI was linked to reduced overall survival compared with
superﬁcial  LVSI (P < .001), whereas cervical/endocervical LVSI showed no signiﬁcant  association
with overall survival (P = .273). Tumor grade, deep LVSI, and cervical involvement predicted nodal
metastasis, whereas the microcystic, elongated, and fragmented pattern did not. These ﬁndings 
support using a threshold of ≥5 LVSI foci on at least 1 slide―as opposed to summing across
slides―as a marker of worse overall survival. For optimal evaluation, at least 7 tumor inﬁltration 
front samples/blocks should be taken, including deep myometrium and cervical/endocervical canal,
to ensure adequate assessment and identify patients at higher risk of nodal spread.

for prognostic indicators. One of the most important prognostic
factors is lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI). Cases with LVSI are
associated with higher rates of lymph node metastasis, pelvic
recurrence, and distant metastasis.2-4 LVSI is deﬁned as the pres­
ence of tumor cells within endothelium-lined spaces at the tumor
inﬁltration front―the area where the tumor ends and the inﬁl­
trating myometrium begins, independent of the main tumor mass.

• Weight of the hysterectomy
• Largest tumor diameter
• Presence and localization of metastatic lymph nodes (isolated
pelvic, pelvic + paraaortic, isolated paraaortic, others such as
renal vein, parametrial, omental, etc.)
• Number of metastatic lymph nodes.

Currently, it has been demonstrated that the presence of
substantial LVSI, rather than just its presence, is crucial in
determining prognosis. This information has been incorporated
into the current guidelines for managing the disease and the
latest Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging.5
There are a range of opinions regarding the number of LVSI that
are considered substantial. The FIGO 2023 staging, 2020 World
Health Organization Classiﬁcation of Female Genital Tumors, and
the European Society of Gynecological Oncology/European Soci­
ety for Radiotherapy and Oncology/European Society of Pathol­
ogy guidelines deﬁne  substantial LVSI as ≥5, whereas the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline deﬁnes it as
≥4, and the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting and
IsGyP 2019 Endometrial Cancer Project recommendations deﬁne 
it as ≥3.6-10 Although substantial LVSI has been included in these
guidelines, it remains one of the key challenges in the evaluation
of LVSI in endometrial carcinoma, particularly with semi­
quantitative use of 2-, 3-, or 4-tier scoring systems.11-13 However,
due to a lack of data, it is unclear whether these numbers should
be obtained on a single slide or counted and summed across all
slides. Additionally, it remains unknown whether the number of
samples submitted from the tumor has any effect on the
commonly deﬁned  substantial LVSI number, or whether the
sampling site of the tumor (uterus or cervix) and the location of
LVSI itself (uterus or cervix, surface or deep) are signiﬁcant fac­
tors. This study aimed to assess the relationship between
macroscopic/sampling parameters and LVSI count and to deter­
mine the optimal cutoff for distinguishing focal and substantial
LVSI.

Microscopically assessed parameters included:
• Sampling site of the tumor (corpus uteri alone or both corpus
uteri and cervix)
• Tumor grade (I, II, or III)
• Tumor histologic type
• Number of samples having a tumor inﬁltration front
• Number of LVSI per slide showing a tumor inﬁltration front
and total number of LVSI
• Number of samples from the cervix or endocervix
• Number of samples that included the serosal surface
• Presence of microcystic, elongated, fragmented (MELF)
pattern
• Depth of LVSI (superﬁcial or combined superﬁcial + deep)
• Localization of LVSI (only the corpus uteri or additionally
cervix/endocervix)
• Lymph node metastasis: micrometastatic vs macrometastatic.
Slides without a tumor inﬁltration front (ie, slides containing
only tumor tissue or no tumor) were excluded from the study
conducted to determine the optimal number of sections to be
sampled. The LVSI, which was located within the tumor stroma
(observed in a few cases), was not included in the LVSI count
according to checklist recommendation14 (Supplementary Table).
Our institution's established standard protocol was utilized
for tissue submission, which allows for the submission of 2 cer­
vical and 2 endocervical canal samples, as well as at least 4
samples containing full-thickness myometrium and tumor from a
hysterectomy specimen with endometrial carcinoma. However,
this number may increase as needed. For instance, if endocervical
stromal invasion is suspected, additional samples can be
submitted.
The tumor inﬁltration front was deﬁned as an area at least 1
mm deep marking the interface between tumor and stroma. If a
single slide showed >20 LVSI foci poses a spray-like pattern
(Fig. 1A), the number was recorded as “>20” and assigned the
value of 30 during statistical analysis. LVSI numbers from all
relevant slides were summed and grouped as follows: ≥5 and <5,
≥4 and <4, or ≥3 and <3. The number of LVSI foci was recorded
separately for each slide with a tumor inﬁltration front.
LVSI in the cervix/endocervix is deﬁned  as the presence of
lymphovascular invasion within stromal vessels located beneath
the endocervical or ectocervical epithelium (Fig. 1B). Deep myo­
metrial LVSI was deﬁned as LVSI located at least 3 mm beyond the
invasive tumor front in the outer half of the myometrium. This
included either (1) cases where no tumor was seen in the
endometrium but LVSI was detected in the outer myometrium,
especially in the tumor-free endomyometrial sample adjacent to
the tumor, or (2) cases with deep myometrial invasion, where
LVSI was observed >3 mm beyond the deepest point of tumor
inﬁltration into the outer myometrium (Fig. 1C, D). Tumors with
deep invasion and a tumor inﬁltration front near the serosa were
not classiﬁed as having deep LVSI. However, LVSI located near the
serosa but distant from the tumor front was considered deep
LVSI.
The authors noted that in some hysterectomies, most slides
showed no LVSI, whereas 1 to 2 slides showed a high number of

Materials and Methods
Case Selection and Inclusion Criteria
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
under research number GO-23-203. Of the 1278 patients diag­
nosed with endometrial cancer between 2014 and 2023, 760
cases reported as LVSI negative in pathology reports were
excluded. A total of 518 patients were initially included: 269 with
reported LVSI positivity and 249 with unspeciﬁed  LVSI status.
Hematoxylin and eosin slides were unavailable for 27 cases. Upon
re-examination under light microscopy, LVSI was not identiﬁed in
235 cases―most of which (179 or 76.1%) were consultation cases
lacking LVSI documentation in the original reports. An additional
46 cases were excluded due to contamination, autolysis, or other
artifacts that precluded an objective assessment. In these cases,
the extent of technical artifacts was such that grading and his­
totype determination of the tumor were not possible. Two further
cases were excluded because the endomyometrial junction could
not be identiﬁed.  Ultimately, 208 hysterectomies that met the
checklist criteria14 (Supplementary Table) and demonstrated
unequivocal LVSI positivity were included in the ﬁnal  analysis.
The checklist criteria are detailed in the Supplementary Material.
For these 208 cases, each hematoxylin and eosin slide containing
a tumor inﬁltration front was thoroughly examined under light
microscopy, and the number of LVSI foci per slide was recorded.

The parameters obtained from pathology reports are as

were retrieved from hospital and national health databases and
conﬁrmed via patient phone calls when necessary.

Descriptive Results

Statistical Analysis

Two hundred eight hysterectomies with LVSI (45 consults, 163
in-house) were included in the study. The mean age of patients
was 61.37 years (range, 36-85; SD, 9.93). One hundred ﬁfty cases
(72.1%) had ≥5 LVSI foci. For alternative cutoffs, 167 cases (80.3%)
had ≥4, and 180 cases (86.5%) had ≥3. Of the 208 hysterectomies,
13 patients did not undergo lymphadenectomy, metastatic status
was unknown in 38 patients, 84 patients had no metastatic
lymph nodes, and 73 patients had lymph node metastases.
The mean number of slides demonstrating the tumor inﬁl­
tration front was 6 (range, 0-15; SD, 2.45). Slides showing the
serosal surface had a mean count of 4.7 (range, 0-15; SD, 2.2). The
mean number of sections obtained from the cervix and endo­
cervix was 3.6 (range, 0-8; SD, 1.4). The details of the evaluated
parameters and study cohort are provided in Table 1.

All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS, version 23.0.
Descriptive statistics for histologic diagnosis, hysterectomy
weight, tumor size, number of samples submitted from the
tumor inﬁltration  front, tumor localization, number of LVSI
foci, presence of MELF pattern, and metastatic lymph node
data (number and site) were summarized using mean ± SD,
median (25th-75th percentile), or frequency/percentage as
appropriate.
Associations with lymph node metastasis were assessed using
the Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, or χ2 test based
on variable type and parametric assumptions. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine a cutoff
value for total LVSI. As data for total LVSI were nonparametric and
the substitution would not affect results, the value of 30 was used
for any case where LVSI count exceeded 20.
The SD of LVSI counts across slides from each patient was
used to represent variation. The signiﬁcance  threshold was set
at P < .05.

Results in Correlation With Total Lymphovascular Invasion
Three literature-based cutoffs for total LVSI (≥5 vs <5, ≥4 vs
<4, and ≥3 vs <3) were evaluated in 208 hysterectomies.

Although lymph node metastasis was signiﬁcantly  associated
with the ≥5 cutoff (P = .038), there was no significant association
for the ≥4 and ≥3 thresholds (P = .082 and P = .425, respectively)
(Table 2). Based on these results, the threshold for substantial
LVSI was set at ≥5 in this study. Detailed analyses according to
LVSI counts are presented in Table 3. Total LVSI increased with
larger tumor diameter, histologic type (serous vs endometrioid),
tumor grade (1 + 2 vs 3), and the number of tumor inﬁltration
front samples (P = .04, P < .001, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). In
contrast, LVSI was not increased in tumors with the MELF pattern
(P = .757). Moreover, the rate of substantial (≥5) LVSI detection
rose with a higher number of samples with tumor inﬁltration
front (P < .001). LVSI was also more common in tumors involving
the cervix or endocervical canal (P < .001). Lymphovascular in­
vasion in the cervix/endocervix and deep myometrium distant
from the tumor was signiﬁcantly associated with increased total
LVSI (both P < .001). Substantial (≥5) LVSI was also signiﬁcantly 
more frequent in these subgroups (P = .007 and P = .020,
respectively).
There was a positive correlation between the number of
samples with tumor invasive front and total LVSI (r = 0.212, P <
.001). This signiﬁcance  held when cases were grouped as ≥5
versus <5 LVSI (P = .045). An ROC analysis determined the
number of inﬁltration front samples needed to detect substantial
LVSI. Detection of ≥5 LVSI increased with up to 7 tumorinﬁltrated samples; beyond 7, detection rates plateaued (sensi­
tivity, 50.7%; speciﬁcity, 64%; area under the curve, 59.1). To
examine if this threshold was inﬂuenced  by tumor size, the
number of inﬁltration front samples per centimeter of tumor was

calculated. However, total LVSI did not increase with a higher
sample/cm ratio (P = .816).

Correlation of Metastatic Lymph Nodes and the Presence of
Metastatic Lymph Nodes
Of the 208 patients, 157 had known lymph node status (84
benign; 73 with metastasis, including 64 macrometastatic, 8
micrometastatic, and 1 with isolated tumor cells) (Table 1).
Table 4 details parameters related to the presence and
number of metastatic lymph nodes. Both were signiﬁcantly
associated with increasing tumor diameter and tumor grade
(P = .032 and P = .025). Serous tumors were associated with a
higher number of metastatic lymph nodes (P = .008). The
MELF pattern did not predict lymph node metastasis (P = .971
and P = .686 for presence and number, respectively). Cervical
or endocervical involvement correlated with higher presence
(P = .023) and number (P < .001) of lymph node metastases.
Moreover, patients with LVSI in the cervix/endocervix or LVSI
in deep myometrium had more lymph node metastases
(presence: P = .017 and 0.026; number: P = .003 and <.001,
respectively).
To assess whether LVSI should be measured per slide or
summed, 150 substantial LVSI cases (≥5) were divided as follows:
• 124 had ≥5 LVSI on at least 1 slide
• 26 reached ≥5 by summing across slides

investigated the amount of LVSI.12,13,15-17 The prognostic value of
substantial LVSI is now widely accepted and has been incorpo­
rated into the World Health Organization 2020 classiﬁcation and
guidelines.6 The FIGO 2023 staging system deﬁnes  substantial
LVSI as ≥5 foci,5 although interobserver agreement among pa­
thologists remains suboptimal,18 and there is still no clear
consensus on the exact cutoff number. Some studies have pro­
posed using thresholds of ≥39,10 or ≥4 LVSI foci.8,12,17
Regarding the commonly used LVSI cutoffs in the literature,
we observed that a threshold of ≥5 vs <5 was signiﬁcant  in
predicting lymph node metastasis in our study, both in terms of
the number of metastatic lymph nodes and lymph node posi­
tivity. In contrast, cutoffs of 4 vs <4 and ≥3 vs <3 were not sta­
tistically signiﬁcant.  However, no difference in overall survival
was observed between focal LVSI and any of the aforementioned
cutoffs. Although overall survival is not the sole clinical param­
eter indicative of prognosis, this does not necessarily imply a lack
of prognostic value. These ﬁndings  suggest that, when deter­
mining a cutoff for LVSI to predict lymph node metastasis, a
threshold of ≥5 foci appears to be the most appropriate.
One of the ongoing controversies in LVSI evaluation is whether
the number of foci should be assessed on at least a single slide or
summed across all slides. This study also aimed to address this
question. Among patients with substantial LVSI (≥5, n = 150),
there was no signiﬁcant difference in lymph node metastasis or
the number of metastatic lymph nodes between those with ≥5
foci on at least 1 slide (n = 124) and those with ≥5 foci only when
summed across slides (n = 26). The literature on this issue re­
mains inconclusive. For example, in the study by Peter et al,17
substantial LVSI was deﬁned as the presence of ≥4 foci on a single
slide, and pelvic lymph node recurrence was used as a clinical
endpoint. In contrast, our study divided patients with substantial
LVSI into 2 groups: 1 with ≥5 foci on at least 1 slide (n = 124), as
in the study by Peter et al,14 and another with ≥5 foci only when
summing across multiple slides (n = 26). Although no difference
in lymph node positivity was observed between these 2 groups at
diagnosis, overall survival analysis revealed that patients with ≥5
foci on at least a single slide had a worse clinical prognosis. These
ﬁndings  highlight the importance of clearly deﬁning  how sub­
stantial LVSI is determined in pathology reports. Further inves­
tigation in larger cohorts―including patients with negative LVSI,
substantial LVSI across multiple slides, and substantial LVSI on a
single slide―is warranted.
The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting guideline
identiﬁes several artifacts that may mimic LVSI, the most notable

No signiﬁcant difference was found in metastatic lymph node
count (P = .463) or presence (P = .944) between these groups.

Lymphovascular Space Invasion Distribution Per Slide
LVSI counts were recorded per slide. In some hysterectomies,
only 1 to 2 slides showed clustered LVSI, suggesting extensive
invasion despite many negative slides. To evaluate variability, a
variation score was calculated for LVSI distribution across slides.
As variation increased, total LVSI increased (P < .001), but varia­
tion was not associated with the number of samples (P = .952).
Cases with substantial (≥5) LVSI had signiﬁcantly  higher varia­
tion than focal cases (P < .001).

Results of the Overall Survival Analysis
Of the 208 patients, 134 were alive, 60 had died, and the
survival status of the remaining 14 was unknown. The mean
follow-up duration was 44.3 months (range, 1-131; SD, 30).
No signiﬁcant  difference in overall survival was found be­
tween focal and substantial LVSI cases. Cutoff-based survival
analysis using thresholds of ≥5, ≥4, and ≥3 yielded P values of
.248, .244, and .817, respectively. However, deeper LVSI was
signiﬁcantly associated with worse overall survival than super­
ﬁcial  LVSI (P = .001; Fig. 2A). No overall survival difference was
observed based on cervical/endocervical LVSI (P = .273). Among
cases with ≥5 total LVSI, those with ≥5 on at least 1 slide had
signiﬁcantly worse overall survival than those who reached ≥5 by
summing (P = .023; Fig. 2B). A multivariate Cox regression anal­
ysis, including tumor grade, histologic type, presence of meta­
static lymph nodes, tumor location (uterus vs uterus and cervix),
and having deep LVSI and ≥5 total LVSI (those with ≥5 on at least
1 slide vs summing), revealed that serous histology (P < .000;
hazard ratio, 3.770; CI, 1.865-7.621) and having a positive meta­
static lymph node were associated with poorer overall survival
(P = .022; hazard ratio, 2.343; CI, 1.131-4.854).

Discussion
LVSI is currently an important parameter in guiding treatment
and determining prognosis.5-8 Not only its presence but also its
extent is clinically signiﬁcant.  Numerous studies have

ples containing the tumor inﬁltration front increased, the
detection rate of LVSI also rose (P < .001 correlation coefﬁcient, 
0.212). Moreover, substantial LVSI (≥5 foci) was more frequently
identiﬁed in cases with a greater number of submitted samples
(P < .001). ROC curve analysis was used to assess how many
samples are necessary to meet the ≥5 and <5 cutoffs and to
determine the threshold beyond which additional sampling
becomes redundant. It was shown that submitting >7 tumor
inﬁltration front samples did not further improve the detection
of substantial LVSI. In practical terms, this suggests that sub­
mitting up to 7 samples is sufﬁcient for accurate LVSI evaluation,
and fewer than 7 sections―particularly in large tumors―may
be inadequate. In the authors’ experience, a few cases of endo­
metrial cancer initially showed borderline lymphovascular
invasion―such as 2 or 3 involved spaces―due to a limited
number of submitted samples. However, upon returning to the
gross room and submitting additional samples, further foci were

being autolysis-induced interpretive difﬁculty and intravascular
seeding. In our archive, 46 cases in which evaluation was
compromised due to such artifacts were excluded from the
analysis. Unfortunately, endometrial autolysis remains a persis­
tent issue, particularly in hysterectomy specimens from devel­
oping countries. It is imperative that medical centers address this
issue with the utmost seriousness. When necessary, preventive
measures should be implemented through close collaboration
between pathologists and clinicians, supported by comprehen­
sive training programs for technical and ancillary staff. Such an
approach would not only enhance the quality and consistency of
tissue processing but also minimize the occurrence of ﬁxation- 
related problems that may compromise diagnostic accuracy and
reproducibility.
The assessment of LVSI in this study was based on evaluation
at the tumor inﬁltration  front, in accordance with recently
published practical guidelines and the recommendations out­
lined in checklist14 (also included as Supplementary Material).
This study sought to determine the role of an optimal sampling
strategy and the required sample number in accurately

identiﬁed, leading to reclassiﬁcation as substantial lymphovas­
cular invasion.
This study is the ﬁrst  in the literature to demonstrate that
the location of sampling, as well as the location and depth of
LVSI, are critical factors. It was observed that when LVSI was
located deep within the myometrium, the total number of
LVSI foci was signiﬁcantly higher. Among the 27 cases with
deep LVSI, 25 (92.6%) had substantial LVSI (≥5 foci), whereas
only 2 (7.4%) had focal LVSI (<5 foci). Deep myometrial LVSI
was deﬁned  as LVSI located at least 3 mm beyond the inva­
sive tumor front in the outer half of the myometrium. This
included either (1) cases where no tumor was seen in the
endometrium but LVSI was detected in the outer myome­
trium, especially in the tumor-free endomyometrial sample
adjacent to the tumor, or (2) cases with deep myometrial
invasion, where LVSI was observed >3 mm beyond the
deepest point of tumor inﬁltration  into the outer myome­
trium (Fig. 1C, D). Tumors with deep invasion and a tumor
inﬁltration  front near the serosa were not classiﬁed  as having
deep LVSI. However, LVSI located near the serosa but distant
from the tumor front was considered deep LVSI.
Deep LVSI was signiﬁcantly  associated with lymph node
metastasis―both in terms of the number of metastatic lymph
nodes (P = .001) and overall lymph node positivity (P = .026).
Among the 27 patients with deep LVSI, 8 either lacked lympha­
denectomy or had unknown nodal status. Of the remaining 19
patients, 14 (73.7%) had positive lymph nodes and 5 (26.3%) were
negative. Although deep LVSI was also linked to poor overall
survival, this association did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in
multivariate analysis. To our knowledge, only Matsuo et al19 have
previously addressed the prognostic relevance of both deep and
substantial LVSI in the English-language literature. Although their
study included 70 patients who were LVSI positive, our study
evaluated 208 LVSI-positive hysterectomies and demonstrated
the impact of deep LVSI on lymph node positivity in a larger
cohort.
Similar to deep LVSI, the presence of LVSI in the cervix or
endocervical canal was associated with a higher total number of
LVSI foci (P < .001). Among the 39 cases with known cervical or
endocervical LVSI, 35 (89.7%) had substantial LVSI (≥5 foci),
whereas 4 had focal LVSI (<5 foci). Cervical or endocervical LVSI
was also signiﬁcantly  associated with lymph node meta­
stasis―both in terms of the number of metastatic lymph nodes
(P = .003) and lymph node positivity (P = .017). Of the 31 pa­
tients with known nodal status or who had undergone lym­
phadenectomy, 21 (67.7%) had positive lymph nodes, whereas
10 (32.3%) had negative nodes. Nevertheless, in survival anal­
ysis, the presence of LVSI in the cervix or endocervical canal did
not show a statistically signiﬁcant  correlation with overall
survival.
This is a retrospective, single-center study in which sampling
was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. A key
limitation of this study is the lack of prospective data. Due to the
standardized and retrospective nature of the study, which results
in low variability, it is not possible to deﬁnitively determine the
minimum number of samples required to predict substantial
LVSI. It also remains unclear, based on this study alone, how many
samples are required from the deep myometrium or cervix/
endocervix to reliably identify substantial LVSI.
In daily practice, in addition to sampling the tumor inﬁltration
front during grossing, it is essential to include sections from the
deep myometrium and cervix/endocervical canal, even if no gross
tumor is visible. These samples should be carefully examined
under the microscope, with particular attention to the presence

of LVSI in these regions. If LVSI is identiﬁed in the deep myome­
trium or cervix/endocervical canal, the tumor is likely to exhibit
substantial LVSI and a higher risk of lymph node metastasis.
Furthermore, the presence of deep LVSI may also indicate a
poorer overall survival.
The MELF pattern has historically been considered a form of
myometrial invasion associated with lymph node metastasis and
aggressive tumor behavior.20,21 However, current literature re­
22,23
ﬂects  divergent views on its prognostic
In this
study, all slides from the 208 LVSI-positive hysterectomies were
re-evaluated by experienced gynecologic pathologists for the
presence of the MELF pattern, based on its recently deﬁned 
microscopic features and considering potential histologic
mimics. The MELF pattern was not found to be signiﬁcantly 
associated with substantial lymphovascular invasion (P = .536) or
lymph node metastasis, either in terms of the number of meta­
static lymph nodes (P = .686) or overall lymph node positivity
(P = .971).
As previously demonstrated, higher total LVSI counts and
increased lymph node positivity were more frequently observed
in tumors with larger diameters, higher histologic grades, and
serous histology compared with endometrioid type.
The number of LVSI foci on each slide was recorded individ­
ually. The authors observed that in some hysterectomy speci­
mens, several slides showed no LVSI, whereas 1 or 2 slides
contained numerous foci, ultimately meeting the criteria for
substantial lymphovascular invasion. To evaluate the effect of
macroscopic sampling and the total number of slides on this
distribution, a variation score was calculated to reﬂect interslide
differences in LVSI counts. This analysis revealed that interslide
variability was signiﬁcantly higher in cases with greater total LVSI
(P < .001). Similarly, cases with substantial LVSI (≥5 foci)
exhibited greater variation (P < .001). Interestingly, this vari­
ability did not increase with the number of submitted samples
(P = .952). This suggests that beyond a certain point, increasing
the number of samples does not proportionally increase vari­
ability, indicating a limit to the diagnostic value of excessive
sampling.
The strengths of this study include its relatively large sample
size, standardized surgical sampling guided by internal protocols,
and the involvement of experienced pathologists. It also ad­
dresses several controversial topics that remain underexplored in
the literature. However, key limitations include its retrospective
design and considerable variability in sampling among consul­
tation cases. Moreover, the study cohort comprises only LVSIpositive cases, with comparisons limited to substantial vs focal
LVSI, preventing the assessment of prognostic parameters in
LVSI-negative cases.
In conclusion, this study evaluated 208 cases of endometrial
cancer and underscored the importance of macroscopic sampling
in the assessment of LVSI. A greater number of sections from the
tumor inﬁltration  front was associated with a higher detection
rate of substantial LVSI. Although sampling beyond 7 sections did
not yield signiﬁcant  additional beneﬁt,  submitting fewer than
7―particularly in large tumors―may be insufﬁcient. A threshold
of ≥5 vs <5 LVSI foci was signiﬁcantly  associated with lymph
node metastasis; however, no cutoff was predictive of prognosis.
Notably, identifying ≥5 foci on a single slide―rather than
distributed across multiple slides―was linked to poorer overall
survival. The study also recommends including sections from the
deep myometrium and cervix/endocervical canal, in addition to
the tumor inﬁltration front. The presence of LVSI in these loca­
tions may indicate both extensive lymphovascular invasion and
adverse overall survival due to deep
