ABSTRACT
Background. Accurate LN examination is critical for staging and prognosis in pancreatic cancer. However, the ideal
number of LNs required for precise staging and improved
survival remains unclear. This study aimed to determine
the optimal number of lymph nodes (LNs) to retrieve during pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer to minimize false
node-negative (false N0) rates and assess its impact on survival outcomes.
Methods. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data
from patients undergoing curative-intent upfront surgery
for pancreatic cancer at two tertiary centers in South Korea
(2010–2021). An exploration cohort of 808 patients was
used to identify LN retrieval thresholds, and the results
were validated in an independent cohort of 444 patients. The
study excluded patients who received neoadjuvant therapy or

had fewer than two retrieved LNs. False N0 rates and 5 year
overall survival were analyzed.
Results. In the exploration cohort, examining 16 LNs
reduced the false N0 rate to 18.9%, whereas in the validation cohort, retrieving 12 LNs resulted in a false N0 rate of
19.5%. Among the node-negative (N0) patients, retrieving
up to 21 LNs was associated with improved 5 year overall
survival. Differences in cutoff values between cohorts were
attributed to demographic variations and inclusion of fewer
LNs retrieved but higher detection of metastatic nodes in the
validation cohort.
Conclusions. Retrieving a sufficient number of LNs during
pancreatectomy is essential to reducing false N0 rates and
improving survival outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.
These findings highlight the need for standardized LN evaluation protocols and support further prospective, multi-center
studies to optimize staging accuracy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of
the most aggressive malignancies, characterized by poor
prognosis and limited long-term survival. Among several
prognostic factors, lymph node (LN) status significantly
influences disease progression and guides postoperative
treatment strategies.1,2 Accurate staging of LN involvement
is crucial because it informs prognosis and impacts adjuvant
therapy decisions.
Current guidelines, such as those from the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), recommend
the retrieval and examination of at least 12 LNs during

pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer.3 However, evidence
suggests that retrieving more LNs may further improve staging accuracy by reducing the risk of false node-negative
(false N0) diagnoses.4,5 Although the NCCN guidelines
provide a valuable baseline, the optimal number of LNs to
be examined to minimize staging errors and maximize prognostic reliability remains a topic of debate, emphasizing the
need for further research to refine these recommendations.
This study aimed to identify the optimal number of LNs
to be retrieved and examined during pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer to mitigate the risk of false N0 diagnoses. By
analyzing retrospective clinical data, we aimed to deliver
evidence-based recommendations to enhance the accuracy
of nodal staging and the prognostic stratification of patients
after curative resection.
METHODS
Study Population
Exploration Cohort
This study included patients who underwent curativeintent surgery for PDAC at Samsung Medical Center
between 2010 and 2021 and excluded patients who received
neoadjuvant treatment or underwent open-and-closure due
to unexpectedly advanced-stage or unresectable disease.
The institutional review boards of Samsung Medical Center
(SMC 2023-07-025) and Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine (YUHS 4-2024-0900) approved
this study and waived the requirement for written informed
consent from participants because the research posed minimal risk to subjects and lacked a basis for anticipation of
objection to the agreement.
Study Population
Validation Cohort
An independent validation cohort included patients who
underwent upfront surgery for pancreatic cancer without
neoadjuvant treatment at Severance Hospital between 2010
and 2021. The data collected included clinicopathologic
information and survival outcomes. The findings from the
exploration cohort were externally validated using this validation cohort.
Perioperative Data and Survival Outcomes
Demographic information, clinical characteristics, operative outcomes, and pathologic reports were retrospectively
reviewed. Pathologic staging was based on the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
staging system.6 The number of harvested and positive LNs
was documented. Data concerning recurrence were obtained

from medical records. Recurrence was suspected when
tumor marker elevation coincided with radiologic findings
indicative of recurrence. Confirmation of suspected recurrence was attempted via positron emission tomography
(PET)-computed tomography (CT) or biopsy when possible.
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from
surgery to the diagnosis of recurrence, and overall survival
(OS) was defined as the interval from surgery to death from
any cause.
Definition of False N0 Rate and Statistical Modeling
False N0 was defined as the probability of a node-positive patient being misclassified as node-negative due to
inadequate lymph node retrieval and examination. To estimate the false N0 rate relative to the number of pathologically examined lymph nodes, we applied the methodology
described by Gönen et al.7 and Robinson et al.8 This method
assumes that each retrieved lymph node independently has
a certain probability of harboring metastasis, and models
the likelihood of missing metastatic nodes using a binomial
distribution framework. Specifically, the false N0 rate at a
given number of examined LNs was estimated by modeling
the probability that no metastatic node would be detected
despite the presence of metastatic nodal disease. The prevalence of nodal metastasis observed in the cohort was used as
the baseline probability in the calculation. All analyses were
performed under the assumption of independent detection
probability per node, consistent with previous applications
of this model.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between patient groups were performed
using Student’s t test for continuous variables and the chisquare test for categorical variables. A p value lower than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
To investigate the impact that the number of retrieved
LNs had on OS, a restricted cubic spline function was used
to depict the 5 year OS. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA) and R software (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
The demographic and clinicopathologic data for the
exploration cohort (n = 808) and the validation cohort (n
= 444) were compared, and the results are presented in
Table 1. The mean preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9
(CA 19-9) level was significantly higher in the exploration
cohort than in the validation cohort (649.7 vs. 276.6 U/mL;
P = 0.021). The prevalence of the American Society of

Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or 4 was higher in the
validation cohort than in the exploration cohort (47.9% vs.
12.9 %; P < 0.001). The patients in the validation cohort
experienced a longer hospital stay (17.1 vs. 11.5 days; P <
0.001).
In the pathology report, the number of examined LNs was
greater in the exploration cohort than in the validation cohort
(18.2 vs. 16.6; P = 0.011). Statistically significant differences were observed in the proportion of patients regarding
pathologic stage, T stage, and N stage. A higher percentage
of patients in the validation cohort received adjuvant treatment than in the exploration cohort (82.3% vs. 69.2%; P
< 0.001). The median OS was significantly longer in the
validation cohort than in the development cohort (35.8 vs.
29.0 months; P = 0.022).
Figure 1 illustrates the patient selection process for cutoffpoint analysis performed for both the exploration (Fig. 1A)
and validation (Fig. 1B) cohorts. The inclusion criteria for

the analysis specified patients with at least two retrieved
and pathologically examined LNs. The patients with at least
one metastatic LN (pN1 or pN2) were included in the cutoff
analysis sets, assuming the possibility of false N0 among
these patients. Finally, the cutoff analysis included 437
patients in the exploration cohort and 224 patients in the
validation cohort.
The comparisons between the cutoff analysis sets from
exploration (n = 437) and validation (n = 224) cohorts
are shown in Table 2. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was more
prevalent in the validation cohort than in the exploration
cohort (41.1% vs. 33.2%; P = 0.049). The validation cohort
also had a significantly higher proportion of patients with
an ASA score of 3 or 4 (47.8% vs. 11.4%; P < 0.001) and
longer hospital stays (17.3 vs. 12.3 days; P < 0.001). Differences in pathologic stage were notable, with more patients
having stage III and N2 disease in the validation cohort than
in the exploration cohort (29.5% vs. 12.6%; P < 0.001 for

both). The number of retrieved and pathologically examined
LNs did not differ significantly between the two sets (20.7
vs. 19.4; P = 0.138). However, the number of metastatic LNs
was higher in the validation cohort (3.0 ± 2.7 vs. 2.4 ± 2.4;
P = 0.006). More patients in the validation cohort received
adjuvant treatment than in the exploration cohort (82.4% vs.
72.4%; P = 0.005). No significant differences in survival
were noted between the two groups.
Figure 2 illustrates the false N0 rate relative to the number of pathologically examined LNs in both the exploration and validation sets. Detailed false N0 rates for each LN
count are available in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. In the
exploration set, retrieving 15 LNs resulted in a false N0 rate
of 20.5%, whereas dissecting 16 LNs reduced the false N0
rate further to 18.9%. In the validation set, retrieving 12 LNs
reduced the false N0 rate to 19.5%, and retrieving 16 LNs
further decreased it significantly to 13.4%.
The linear relationship between the total number of examined LNs and the 5 year OS probability is demonstrated in
Fig. 3, based on an integrated analysis of the exploration and
validation cohorts (n = 1252). No significant survival trends
were observed in the overall patient population (Fig. 3A).
However, among the N0 patients (Fig. 3B), survival probability consistently improved with an increase in the number of examined LNs up to 21, with 16 LNs serving as an

True Node Positive

intermediate point. Among the N1 and N2 patients (Fig. 3C),
a similar trend of improved OS with an increasing number of
examined LNs was noted, although it was less pronounced
than among the N0 patients.
DISCUSSION
Nodal status is a crucial prognostic factor in PDAC,
affecting both OS and disease progression. 1,2 This study
sought to determine the probability of false N0 status in
PDAC based on the number of retrieved and pathologically
examined LNs. A comprehensive review of more than 800
consecutive cases in the exploration cohort was conducted
to explore the relationship between the specific number of
examined LNs and the false N0 rate. These findings were
subsequently validated using an independent cohort. Additionally, the survival trend based on the total number of
pathologically examined nodes also was investigated.
Accurate nodal staging in PDAC has significant clinical
implications. As a key component of the AJCC cancer staging system,6 nodal status plays a pivotal role in determining prognosis. A recent meta-analysis identified pathologic
nodal status as a key prognostic factor for early recurrence
(within 12 months after surgery), together with factors
such as the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy and elevated

preoperative CA 19-9 levels.9 Moreover, a previous study
from our institution demonstrated that LN metastasis had a
higher odds ratio for predicting 5 year recurrence-free survival than tumor size, differentiation, or resection margin
status.10 In addition to its prognostic value, LN status is
essential for guiding adjuvant treatment strategies because
it may influence the efficacy of adjuvant treatment.11
Another study reported that patients with metastatic LNs
responded better to oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and
fluorouracil (FOLFIRINOX)-based adjuvant therapy than
those with node-negative disease.12 Concerning additional
radiotherapy, Liu et al.13 demonstrated that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after resection of pancreatic cancer leads to
survival improvement only for patients with node-positive
disease. Taken together, precise nodal evaluation, which
decreases the false N0 rate, is of critical importance in
optimizing therapeutic outcomes for patients with resected
PDAC.

Regarding the adequate number of LNs retrieved during pancreatectomy for PDAC, previous studies have proposed various thresholds for accurate staging. Notably, the
NCCN guidelines recommend retrieving at least 12 LNs,3
whereas the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) suggests a minimum of 15 LNs for patients
without neoadjuvant treatment.14 In 2019, Arrington et al.15
recommended sampling 11 to 17 LNs and suggested that 18
LNs are required to capture 90% of node-positive disease.15
Hua et al.16 set LN thresholds based on T stage, recommending examination of at least 16, 21, and 23 LNs respectively
for T1, T2, and T2 tumors.
Our study aimed to reduce the false N0 rate to 20%
identifying thresholds of 16 LNs in the exploration cohort.
Importantly, this finding was validated in an independent validation cohort, in which examination of 16 LNs
was associated with a false N0 rate of 13.4%, confirming
the robustness of our threshold across different patient

populations. Although these thresholds are somewhat consistent with previous recommendations, our study uniquely
correlated the number of retrieved LNs with quantitatively
derived false N0 rates across two independent cohorts.
Furthermore, by linking LN retrieval numbers to 5 year OS
outcomes, we extended the clinical significance beyond
staging accuracy alone. To facilitate further multicenter
studies and to improve staging accuracy, development
of a standardized protocol for nodal status evaluation is
needed.

The difference in cutoff values between the exploration
and validation sets could be attributed to subtle differences
in patient and procedural characteristics. Notably, although
baseline tumor markers such as CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) did not differ significantly between the
two sets, a higher proportion of patients in the exploration
set had more advanced pathologic stages of disease. More
complex cases may have required more extensive resections, potentially leading to a higher baseline expectation
for LN retrieval. Despite this, the number of pathologically

FIG. 3  Linear relationship between the number of examined lymph nodes and the 5 year survival probability across both the exploration and
validation cohorts: A in the patients overall, B in the N0 patients, and C in the N1/N2 patients

examined lymph nodes in the exploration set was not markedly lower than in the validation set.
All surgeries in both cohorts were performed under the
assumption of standardized lymphadenectomy by experienced surgeons. Therefore, the observed differences in LN
yield and cutoff values may reflect institutional variability
in the gross handling and pathologic processing of surgical
specimens rather than true differences in surgical technique.
These findings underscore the need to standardize not only
surgical approaches but also pathologic evaluation protocols
across institutions to ensure reproducible LN staging.
Numerous studies have demonstrated a potential correlation between the number of retrieved LNs and survival
outcomes in PDAC. Foundational studies by Slidell et al.17
and Schwarz and Smith,18 based on large national databases,

have established that both the total number of retrieved LNs
and the extent of lymphadenectomy are independently associated with improved survival and staging accuracy in pancreatic cancer.
Some studies have further reported a direct relationship
between the number of retrieved LNs and survival. For
example, Contreras et al.19 analyzed the National Cancer
Data Base (NCDB) in the United States and confirmed
that LN retrieval is positively correlated with survival.
Another ­study 20 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) database reported that the total
number of harvested LNs is a significant protective factor for survival, even for patients with N0 disease. Other
studies emphasized the potential prognostic importance
of retrieving and examining an adequate number of LNs

because it enables more accurate staging and reduces
the risk of undertreating node-positive patients. Prassas
et al.21 underscored the need for sufficient LN harvest for
applying nodal classification systems effectively. Additionally, Tarantino et al.22 demonstrated that the number
of positive lymph nodes itself provides strong prognostic
stratification in PDAC, reinforcing the role of detailed
nodal assessment.
In the context of these studies, our findings further substantiate the importance of LN retrieval and examination in
determining survival outcomes. We observed that retrieving
up to 21 LNs was associated with improved 5 year survival,
particularly for node-negative (N0) patients. This trend was
less pronounced but still evident for node-positive (N1 and
N2) patients, and the cutoff values of 16 and 12 LNs identified in our exploration and validation sets, respectively,
fall within this range. However, the underlying mechanism
remains uncertain. It is unclear whether this association
reflects improved staging accuracy, by minimizing false N0
cases, or a potential therapeutic benefit from extended lymphadenectomy itself. Given the retrospective nature of our
study and variability in pathologic practices, causal inference is limited. We believe that efforts to standardize both
surgical lymphadenectomy and pathologic examination are
necessary preconditions to enable in-depth analysis of the
relationship between LN retrieval and survival. Future prospective studies should be designed for further investigation
of this distinction.
Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged.
First, the retrospective nature of the study introduced inherent biases, including potential variability in data collection
and documentation. This may impact the generalizability
of our findings despite efforts to ensure robust statistical
analysis.
Second, the study involved multiple surgeons performing
pancreatectomies at the same institution during a decade.
Variations in surgical technique and LN dissection practices among surgeons could have influenced the number of
retrieved LNs and the subsequent pathologic evaluation.
Third, differences in gross specimen-handling by pathologists could have contributed further to variability in LN
counts. Additionally, institutional protocols for pre- and
postoperative management, including adjuvant treatment and
surveillance, may vary based on individual expertise and
practices, potentially impacting the consistency of our data.
These limitations underscore the need for standardized
surgical and pathologic protocols in future prospective studies to validate our findings and improve generalizability.
Despite these challenges, our study provides practical guidance for optimizing LN examination and staging in PDAC,
paving the way for more accurate prognostic assessments
and improved patient outcomes. Moreover, this dual-cohort
approach strengthens the reliability of our findings.

In conclusion, we proposed and validated cutoff numbers of LNs for examination to reduce the false N0 rate in
PDAC. By referencing these specific thresholds, clinicians
can minimize the underestimation of LN metastasis, providing a potential foundation for improving oncologic outcomes
for patients with resected PDAC.
