Abstract
Objective: We sought to assess the number of blocks that should routinely be submitted
for microscopic examination of omentectomy specimens associated with neoplasms that
involve the female genital tract.
Methods: Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively reviewed in 1055 cases wherein
the omentum was resected for possible gynecologic cancer staging. We investigated any
associations between the microscopic positivity rate (MPR) and the number of blocks
submitted, block groups (categorized as 1-2 blocks, 3-4 blocks, 5-6 blocks, and >6 blocks),
and block to size ratio (the number of blocks submitted to the widest specimen dimension,
classified as approximate deciles).
Results: Of the 1055 cases we studied, 536 (50.8%) were grossly normal, and 519 (49.2%)
were abnormal. Within the grossly normal group, there were no statistically significant
differences in MPR between the block groups and between cases with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 blocks
submitted (P > .50 for all pairwise comparisons). Cochran-Armitage tests for trend did not
show any linear trend between increasing block groups (P = .88) or increasing block to size
ratios (P = .39) and MPR; a binomial logistic regression analysis confirmed that neither
block groups (odds ratio, 1.144 [95% CI, 0.794-1.648]; P = .47) nor block to size ratio (odds
ratio, 1.022 [95% CI, 0.770-1.358]; P = .88) showed a statistically significant linear relation
to MPR. For diffusely or multifocally abnormal cases, the highest MPR (95.5%) was reached
at the 1 to 2 blocks group level, and MPR did not statistically significantly increase with
higher levels of sampling.

K E Y P O INT S
• This retrospective study analyzed
the MPR of various levels of
sampling of omentectomy
specimens associated with
neoplasms that involve the female
genital tract.
• For a grossly normal omentum
and for multifocally/diffusely
abnormal omentum, our findings
suggest that 1-2 blocks does not
result in a significant decrease in
the MPR compared with higher
levels of sampling.
• Additional studies are required
to address omentum sampling
in specific clinical scenarios,
including following neoadjuvant
therapy.

Conclusions: Submitting 1 to 2 block sections of the omentum in the studied setting
results in an MPR that is not statistically significantly lower than the MPR associated with
higher levels of sampling.

Omentum involvement in endometrial and tubo-ovarian malignancies denotes advancedstage disease.1-3 Given that treatment and prognosis are highly dependent on staging, the
accurate determination of omentum involvement by a gynecologic tract neoplasm is paramount. Omentectomy (or partial omental sampling) has long been a mainstay of staging
procedures for patients with ovarian cancer.4 Omentectomy not only facilitates achieving

status, number of blocks submitted, and largest omental dimension.
Cases for which key study parameters were incomplete were excluded. For most of the study period, the gross manual at our institution called for omentum specimens to be sectioned at 5-mm intervals,
with 1 to 3 sections to be submitted for grossly abnormal omentum
and 6 sections to be submitted grossly normal omentum. Given the
wide spectrum of descriptions for the omentum across the pathology
reports we reviewed, the gross appearances were classified into 4
categories for analytic purposes using preset guidelines:

M ET H O D S
The authors searched the pathology database at an academic medical
center for consecutive cases in which the omentum had been excised
as part of possible gynecologic cancer staging (ie, as a component of
formal surgical staging for a previously diagnosed gynecologic neoplasm or as part of intraabdominal exploration for a gynecologic tract
mass or lesion) between January 2002 and August 2024. Only cases
in which a borderline or malignant neoplasm involved the ovary,
fallopian tube, or uterus were included. The neoplasms included epithelial neoplasms (borderline and malignant), sarcomas, sex cord
stromal tumors, and non-gynecologic primaries with mass-forming
involvement of the gynecologic tract. Cases were excluded if they
failed to meet these inclusion criteria. Surgical pathology reports
were reviewed in detail, and the following items were collected: primary tumor site, histologic subtype, gross appearance, microscopic

Normal. These cases were specifically described as normal;
grossly unremarkable; or showing no distinct or discernable
lesions, nodules, or masses. They were frequently described as
displaying yellow, tan, or reddish lobulated cut surfaces.
Focally abnormal. These omental specimens had a distinct
lesion, encompassing fibrosis, thickening, induration, nodules,
or masses limited to a single discrete abnormality in an otherwise unremarkable specimen. Other descriptors for focal
abnormality included cystic change, “mucinous” change, or
chalky change. Based on specified measurements, a singular
lesion that was described as equal to or less than 10% of the
specimen’s greatest dimension was classified in this category.
The category also includes cases where a separate specimen
was labeled as an omental nodule or implant, even if the separately submitted larger specimen was described as being
grossly unremarkable.
Multifocally abnormal. These omental specimens had the
same identifiable gross discrete lesions described in the focal
category but showed more than 1 focus of abnormality in a
single specimen or had at least 1 abnormality in multiple specimens if separately submitted. Abnormalities for the specimens in this category were frequently described as multiple,
multifocal, several, numerous, or a definite number when the
lesions were countable. Specimens with more than focal areas
described by nonspecific terminologies (eg, fibrous, thickened,
studded, intermixed, interspersed with indistinct lesions) were
also included in this category.
Diffusely abnormal. For these specimens, there was a predominance of the lesional component over the fatty or fibrofatty
areas. They were frequently described as diffuse, replaced,
entirely involved, confluent, grossly positive, or caked. Cut
surfaces were typically described as solid and the omentum as
firm or rubbery.

Microscopic positivity (microscopic abnormality) for tumor was the
primary outcome measure or end point used in this study. A case was
classified as microscopically positive when viable tumor cells were
reported as being definitively present in a section from the omentum.
Samples that showed only acellular mucin, psammoma bodies,
“atypical cells,” and reactive changes were classified as negative if
tumor cells were not concurrently present. The number of blocks
submitted was correlated with the microscopic positivity rate (MPR).
In some analyses, the number of blocks submitted was categorized
arbitrarily into 4 subgroups to facilitate subset analyses: 1 to 2 blocks,

the “optimal cytoreduction” standard that is thought to have tremendous prognostic value in patients with advanced-stage ovarian
cancer5 but is also invaluable in recognizing the 2.3% to 3% of patients with apparently early-stage ovarian cancer whose disease is
upstaged solely due to microscopic disease.6,7 For patients with endometrial cancers, only 0.4% to 1.9% of clinically early-stage disease
are found to have microscopic involvement of the omentum.8,9 Up
to one-third of patients with nonendometrioid or “aggressive”
histotypes show omentum involvement, however; accordingly,
omentectomy is commonly performed in this setting.10,11
The omentum specimen submitted to the pathology laboratory
is often large, and it is neither practical nor cost-effective to microscopically evaluate a large portion of the specimen, especially given
the widespread limitations in resources that the discipline faces.12,13
In contrast, inadequate sampling of the omentum by the pathologist
may lead to a failure to recognize microscopic disease, understaging,
and (potentially) adverse patient outcomes. Only a few prior studies
have attempted to determine the optimal number of blocks that
should be submitted in this setting. Doig and Monaghan14 reviewed
332 cases that were limited to malignant and borderline ovarian
tumors. They concluded that submitting 1 block from a grossly involved omentum is sufficient. Usubutun et al15 evaluated 258 endometrial and ovarian malignancies, inclusive of retrospective and
prospective cohorts, and concluded that 1 block is sufficient when
the omentum is grossly involved. In another analysis, 44 ovarian and
endometrial cases with grossly normal omentum and microscopic
disease were assessed; using a simulated model, the authors found
that 5, 10, and 14 blocks of omentum in such cases will yield a sensitivity of 82%, 95%, and 99%, respectively.16 There are some shared
conclusions between these studies, but overall, the optimal number
of blocks that should routinely be submitted for microscopic examination of staging omentectomy specimens, especially when grossly
unremarkable, is not entirely clear. In the current study, the authors
sought to provide a comprehensive reexamination of the issue, with
an emphasis on grossly normal omentum, using the largest cohort
reported to date and encompassing tumors of various types at different sites in the female genital tract.

3 to 4 blocks, 5 to 6 blocks, and more than 6 blocks. The ratio of the
number of blocks submitted to the longest dimension of the specimen was designated the block to size ratio and was used as an alternative surrogate indicator for the percentage of the omentum sampled.
Subset analyses were performed for cases in which 1% to less than
10%, 10% to less than 20%, 20% to less than 30%, 30% to less than
40%, and 40% or more of the sample had been sampled. Fisher exact
and χ2 tests were used to assess MPR as a function of the number
of blocks submitted, block groups, and the percentage of omentum
sampled, with statistical significance set at ɑ = .05. For further analysis within the grossly normal group, 2 statistical methods were also
performed: a Cochran-Armitage test of trend and binomial logistic
regression. The Cochran-Armitage test of trend was performed to
assess the effects of blocks submitted, block groups, and block to size
ratio on MPR as well as whether statistically significant trends in MPR
as a function of sampling could be identified. Given the dichotomous
nature of our outcome variable (positive or negative for microscopic
disease), binomial logistic regression was also employed using the
same variables. These tests were used adjunctively to substantiate
whether a trend exists, complementing the pairwise comparisons
using Fisher exact tests. These sets of analyses provided a more comprehensive assessment of any potential trends. Statistical analyses
were performed using Microsoft Excel (part of Microsoft 365, version
2410) and IBM SPSS Statistics, version 29, software.

applied; 536 (50.8%) of the 1055 cases had been classified as
having grossly normal omenta, and 519 (49.2%) of the 1055 cases
had been classified as having grossly abnormal omenta. The focally abnormal, multifocally abnormal, and diffusely abnormal
groups comprised 13.2%, 30.0%, and 6.0% of the entire cohort,
respectively. As expected, the MPR for the grossly normal group
(43/536 [8.0%]) was much lower than the MPR for the grossly
abnormal group (442/519 [85.2%]), P < .0001. Similarly, within
the grossly abnormal group, the MPR for the focally abnormal
subgroup (66.4%) was substantially lower than the rates for the
multifocally abnormal (91.1%), diffuse abnormal (96.8%), and the
multifocally + diffusely abnormal (92.1%) subgroups (P < .001
for all).

MPRs and number of blocks submitted
in the grossly normal group
Table 1 shows the MPRs associated with each level of sampling in

cases classified as grossly normal. Of these 536 cases, 512 (95.5%)
had 6 blocks or fewer submitted, with variable representation for
each level of sampling. The overall MPR was 8.0%, and subgroup
analysis of cases with 6 or fewer blocks submitted showed MPRs
that ranged from 6.7% to 11.8%. Notably, there were no statistically
significant differences in the MPR for cases with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
blocks submitted (P > .50 for all pairwise comparisons). A separate analysis classified the cases into subgroups of 1 to 2 blocks, 3
to 4 blocks, 5 to 6 blocks, and more than 6 blocks to account for
the variability in number of cases ( Table 1 ). The MPRs for these 4
subgroups were 6.8%, 9.0%, 8.5%, and 12.5%, respectively; again,
pairwise comparisons showed no statistically significant differences in MPRs between any 2 subgroups. The MPRs for cases with
1 block submitted (10/149 [6.7%]) were not statistically significantly

MPRs and number of blocks submitted
in the grossly abnormal groups
For grossly abnormal cases, Table 1 shows the MPRs associated
with each level of sampling in cases classified as grossly abnormal.
The MPRs for the focally abnormal, multifocally abnormal, diffusely abnormal, and multifocally + diffusely abnormal subgroups
were 66.4% (93/140), 91.1% (288/316), 96.8% (61/63), and 92.1%
(349/379), respectively ( Table 3 ). For the grossly abnormal group
as a whole, the MPRs for the 1 to 2 block group (88%), 3 to 4 block
group (87.1%), 5 to 6 block group (81.2%) showed no statistically

significant differences (P > .05 for all pairwise comparisons). The
MPRs for the more than 6 blocks group (68.2%) was statistically
significantly lower than the other block groups (see “Discussion”).
For the grossly abnormal subgroup as a whole, the MPR for 1 block
sampled (79.4%) was statistically significantly lower than the MPR
for 2 blocks sampled (93.5%) (P = .001).
Among the subgroups of grossly abnormal cases, for the focally
abnormal subgroup (n = 140), there was no statistically significant
difference between the MPRs for the 1 to 2 blocks group (70.1%) and
those for the 3 to 4 blocks (73.0%) or 5 to 6 block (64.3%) groups
( Table 3 ). The MPR for the more than 6 blocks group (28.6%) was
statistically significantly lower than the MPRs for each of the other
block groups. For the multifocally abnormal, diffusely abnormal,
and diffusely + multifocally abnormal subgroups, there were no
statistically significant differences in the MPRs between the block
groups. Overall, sampling above the 1 to 2 blocks level was not
clearly associable with a statistically significantly higher MPR.

MPRs, primary sites, tumor types, and other variables
Table 4 outlines the distribution of tumoral histotypes in the study
cohort and their sites of origin. Overall, 759 (71.9%) cases were tuboovarian/peritoneal, 189 (18%) were uterine, and 107 (10.1%) were
uterine/adnexal synchronous primaries or metastases involving the
gynecologic tract. Gross omental involvement was present in 54.0%
of the tubo-ovarian/peritoneal cases in contrast to only 24.3% of
the endometrial cases. Similarly, the MPR for the grossly abnormal
tubo-ovarian/peritoneal cases (86.8%) was statistically significantly higher than the MPR for the grossly abnormal uterine cases
(71.7%, P = .009). Accordingly, we separately assessed MPRs for the
uterine and tubo-ovarian/peritoneal cases for the various categories
of sampling (1-2 blocks, 3-4 blocks, 5-6 blocks, and >6 blocks), with
the goal of determining whether different sampling-related conclusions could be reached for each anatomic site. Our results for each
of these sites (data not shown) were broadly consistent with the
aforementioned findings for the entire cohort (ie, the MPR for 1-2
blocks is not statistically significantly lower than the MPR for 3-4
blocks, 5-6 blocks, or >6 blocks for the uterine and tubo-ovarian/
peritoneal subgroups).
In addition, we assessed the effect of 3 variables in cases for
which 1 to 2 blocks had been sampled within the grossly normal

different from the MPRs for cases with 2 to 6 blocks submitted
(30/363 [8.3%]; P = .59).
At the other end of the spectrum, MPRs for cases with 6 blocks
submitted (15/190 [7.9%]) were not statistically significantly different from the MPRs for cases with 5 or fewer blocks submitted
(25/322 [7.8%]; P > .99). Various other iterations, including fewer
than 5 blocks vs 5 to 6 blocks vs more than 6 blocks, similarly
showed no statistically significant difference in MPR. These findings were confirmed by a Cochran-Armitage test of trend, which
did not show any linear trend between increasing block groups
and MPR (P = .88), as well as Fisher exact tests for the group as a
whole, showing no statistically significant association between
block groups and MPR (P = .66). The block to size ratio was analyzed as approximate deciles (1% to <10%, 10% to <20%, 20% to
<30%, 30% to <40%, and ≥40%) ( Table 2 ). The MPR was comparable at all levels of sampling for each category (P = .72), and there
was no statistically significant linear trend in MPR as a function
of block groups (P = .882) or block to size ratio. (Cases with 0% to
<10% [n = 15], 10% to <20% [n = 12], 20% to <30% [n = 8], 30% to
<40% [n = 2], and ≥40% [n = 6] sampling showed MPRs of 8.2%,
6.3%, 10.3%, 6.9%, and 10.5%, respectively; P = .39).
Finally, a binomial logistic regression analysis confirmed that
neither block groups (odds ratio, 1.144 [95% CI, 0.794-1.648];
P = .47) nor block to size ratio (odds ratio, 1.022 [95% CI, 0.7701.358]; P = .88) showed a statistically significant linear relation to
MPR, (χ22 = 0.905, P = .64 for model). Overall, within the grossly
normal group, increased sampling (number of blocks submitted,
block to size ratio, block groups) were not statistically significantly
associated with increasing rates of microscopic positivity.

group and found no statistically significant differences in MPR
between uterine and tubo-ovarian/peritoneal primaries (P = .34),
cases in which the omentum’s widest dimension was less than
the cohort median size vs equal to or greater than the cohort median size (P = .63), and cases associated and not associated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = .41). Subset analyses restricted to
grossly normal cases of tubo-ovarian/peritoneal origin (n = 349)
showed that the MPR for cases with 1 to 2 blocks submitted
within the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–positive group was 19.0%
(4/21) compared with 3.8% (4/104) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–negative group (P = .03). Further analysis of the same
subset (grossly normal, tubo-ovarian/peritoneal origin) showed
that within the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–positive group, the
MPR for 1 to 2 blocks (4/21 [19.0%]) was not statistically significantly
different than the MPR for 3 to 4 blocks (3/42 [7.1%]; P = .21), 5 to 6
blocks (7/94 [7.4%]; P = .20), and more than 6 blocks (2/18 [11.1%];
P = .67).

DISCUSSION
In the current analysis, the authors report findings from the largest
study to date exploring the appropriate level of omentum sampling
in neoplasms that involve the female genital tract, inclusive of
grossly normal and abnormal omenta. Relatively few current guidelines are based on primary published data regarding the optimal
sampling of grossly normal cases. The 2017 Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) dataset for histologic reporting of endometrial cancer
recommends submitting 2 to 4 blocks “based on accepted current
practice.”17 The RCP’s 2025 “best practice recommendations,” citing
Doig and Monaghan,14 note that if the omentum is grossly normal
and “the ovary is malignant or borderline on gross inspection or
histological examination,” “thorough sampling is needed” of the
omentum.18 The 2019 endometrial cancer recommendations from

© American Society for Clinical Pathology

the International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists (ISGyP) call
for the submission of “1 representative section per 2 or 3 cm of maximal omental dimension or at least a total of 4 blocks of tissue”19
when the omentum is grossly normal, citing the aforementioned
RCP guidelines17 and Usubutun et al.15 The 2022 recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting on
endometrial cancer endorsed the ISGyP statement, calling for “at
least 4 blocks” to be submitted when the omentum is grossly negative.20,21 Widely used textbooks on grossing give similarly variable
recommendations.22,23 Westra et al,22 for example, note that “5 representative sections are usually sufficient, although some authorities recommend up to 10 sections.” This absence of standardized
recommendations has in turn resulted in variability at the institutional level, as evidenced by our review of a sampling of publicly
available gross manuals, with some institutions making a distinction between the sampling necessary for grossly normal omentum
when the primary is tubo-ovarian (10 sections) vs endometrial (4
sections), and a general variability in the number of sections that
these manuals state should be submitted in this setting.24,25
In the current analysis of a large cohort, we could not identify a
clear evidentiary basis for submitting more than 1 to 2 sections when
the omentum is grossly normal. Using the specific framework of this
study (block groups, block to size ratio, and number of blocks submitted), we did not find that sampling above 1 to 2 sections was associated with a statistically significantly higher rate of microscopic
positivity. Omenta from patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
may represent a group of cases with distinctive findings that require
special handling. For grossly normal omenta associated with neoplasia of tubo-ovarian/peritoneal origin, the MPR for cases with 1 to
2 blocks submitted within the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–positive
group was statistically significantly higher than the MPR for cases
in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–negative group (P = .027). This
finding raises the possibility that post–neoadjuvant chemotherapy

cases are more likely to appear grossly normal but still harbor microscopic disease.26 Within the neoadjuvant chemotherapy–positive group of the same subset, the MPR for 1 to 2 blocks was not
statistically significantly different than the MPR for 3 to 4 blocks, 5
to 6 blocks, or more than 6 blocks. These analyses were limited by
small cohort sizes, however, and accordingly, more extensive sampling of the omentum may be necessary in the post–neoadjuvant
chemotherapy setting, at least until the question can be specifically
evaluated with larger datasets. For cases wherein the omentum
is grossly abnormal in an unequivocal manner, prior studies appeared to show a broad-based consensus that 1 to 2 sections are
sufficient.17-23 Our findings largely validate this guideline. When
our multifocally abnormal and diffusely abnormal groups are combined, the MPR was 95.5% at the 1 to 2 block sampling level and was
not statistically significantly increased by higher levels of sampling.
Our study also assessed, for the first time, the significance of “focal”
abnormality, wherein there is a discrete abnormality in an otherwise unremarkable omentum. This group represented a substantial
6

proportion of our cohort: 27% (140/519) of grossly abnormal cases
and 13% (140/1055) of all cases. The overall MPR for the focally
abnormal group was 66.4%, indicative of a statistically significant
false-positive rate. There was no statistically significant difference
between the MPR for the 1 to 2 block group (70.1%) and that of either
the 3 to 4 block (73%) or the 5 to 6 block (64.3%) groups. The MPR
for the more than 6 blocks group (28.6%) was statistically significantly lower than each of the other block groups. This finding may
reflect the wide variety of gross aberrations that can plausibly be
described as focally abnormal, large subsets of which are ultimately
found to be devoid of microscopic abnormality. Similarly, cases
with extensive sampling (>6 blocks) may overrepresent such cases
because the prosector may be sampling them as though they are
grossly normal if the gross abnormality is perceived to be equivocal.
This group is arguably “intermediate” between the unequivocally
grossly normal and abnormal cases and as such is most likely to
show heterogeneity regarding what is considered focal abnormality.
Future studies are required to further assess the question.

been appropriately sectioned, examined, and concluded to be
grossly normal or multifocally/diffusely abnormal, submitting 1 to
2 sections results in an MPR that is not significantly lower than the
MPR for the specific higher levels of sampling that were assessed
herein, which suggests that any additional information obtained
from such higher levels of sampling are limited. Future studies
using data from different practice settings and different patient
populations are required to further evaluate the question.

In the present analysis, the gross appearance of the omentum
compared with its microscopically determined tumor-positive vs
tumor-negative status was found to have an overall agreement of
85% (the “any abnormality” standard), representing the accuracy of
gross assessment. This finding is less than the 97.1% and 97.3% accuracies previously reported in the studies of Doig and Monaghan14
and Usubutun et al,15 respectively. The discrepancy can be explained
by a myriad of factors associated with differences in study design.
For example, only ovarian cases were part of the studied cohort
in Doig and Monaghan,14 including benign tumors that inherently
overrepresent the true-negative component of the accuracy analysis. Previous studies also variably excluded cases that were reportedly “fibrosed,” several histotypes of ovarian neoplasia, uterine
tumors, and metastatic tumors.14-16 Our analysis included all cases,
regardless of the presence or degree of omentum abnormality, and
was centered on malignancies and borderline tumors. This approach reflects the practical reality that mass-forming involvement
of the gynecologic tract, particularly the ovaries, may not have a
clear histopathologic diagnosis at the time of grossing, but the
associated omentum specimens are nevertheless grossed and sampled similar to those that do. Most importantly, a standard of “any
abnormality” includes every level of gross abnormality, from focal
(lower MPR) to diffuse (higher MPR); the latter standard was used
in most prior studies and, if applied exclusively in the current study,
would have resulted in an MPR of close to 97%. More generally, the
findings in this study highlight the statistical significance of gross
assessment in omentum sampling but also clearly demonstrates
that the predictive ability of gross abnormalities for microscopically
confirmed disease is imperfect.
There are some potential limitations associated with this study,
most of which are inherent to its retrospective design, that should
be considered in any conclusions that are ultimately drawn from
it. Most notably, study cases were based on a review of pathology
reports that were generated over a more than 20-year period, and
as such, necessarily included descriptions from a spectrum of
prosectors at widely varying levels of professional development,
ranging from junior residents and pathologist assistant students
to experienced pathologist assistants. There was likely some heterogeneity and interobserver variability regarding the presence, extensiveness, and descriptions of specific abnormalities. Our analysis
presumed appropriate sectioning and evaluations by a multitude
of individuals over a long period. Imbalances associated with the
number of cases in each block group highlighted the aforementioned variability in practice inherent to the retrospective nature
of the analysis. Furthermore, a block to size ratio for larger omenta
may not reflect a perfectly proportionally increased level of sampling compared with smaller omenta. Future studies that mitigate
these potential limitations would be prospective, submit a fixed
number of blocks regardless of gross abnormality, and have cases be
grossed by a single or limited group of prosectors. The strengths of
this study include its large size, focus of malignancies and borderline tumors, and multifaceted examination of the issue.
In summary, our study suggests that in the setting of neoplasia involving the female genital tract, when an omentum has
