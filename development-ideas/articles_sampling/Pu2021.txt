Abstract
Background: Lymph node (LN) metastasis is associated with decreased survival following resection for
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In N0 disease, increasing total evaluated LN (ELN) correlates
with improved outcomes suggesting patients may be understaged when LNs are undersampled. We aim
to assess the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) following pancreatectomy.
Methods: Data from 1837 patients undergoing surgery were prospectively collected. The binomial
probability law was utilized to analyze the minimum number of examined LNs (minELN) and accurately
characterize each histopathologic stage. LN ratio (LNR) was compared to American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) guidelines.
Results: As ELN total increased, the likelihood of ﬁnding node positive disease increased. An evaluation
based upon the binomial probability law suggested an optimal minELN of 12 for accurate AJCC N
staging. As the number of ELNs increased, the discriminatory capacity of alternative strategies to
characterize LN disease exceeded that offered by AJCC N stage.
Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst study dedicated to optimizing histopathologic staging in PDAC using
models of minELN informed by the binomial probability law. This study highlights two separate cutoffs for
ELNs depending upon prognostic goal and validates that 12 LNs are adequate to determine AJCC N
stage for the majority of patients.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading
cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with a cumulative 5-year overall survival (OS) rate that remains less than

9%.1,2 This is largely attributed to tumor biology, as well as
limitations in all phases of care, including early diagnosis and a
lack of effective systemic therapies.3 In 2018, the 8th edition of

Manual was released with revised N staging guidelines that
convey greater prognostic accuracy for patients with resected
PDAC.4,5 Patients with disease in lymph nodes (LNs) are newly
divided into two groups. In N1 disease, 1–3 LNs contain metastatic foci of disease and in N2 disease there are more than 3
involved LNs identiﬁed.4 This updated staging system has been
validated, relative to the 7th edition staging guidelines in PDAC,
in an analysis across several high-volume PDAC centers.6
An accurate prognostic assessment that relies upon the number
of positive lymph nodes is inherently dependent on the total
number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) in a given specimen. The
techniques of surgical lymphadenectomy and histopathologic
specimen dissection both clearly play a role. Nevertheless, the use of
a minimum number of lymph nodes examined has been suggested
as a surrogate marker of quality control to accurately stage patients.7,8 The College of American Pathologists recommends that a
minimum of 12 LNs be examined at the time of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). These guidelines are based upon literature that
retrospectively suggests a minimum number of ELNs (minELN)
that ranges between 12 and 17 for a pancreatic head tumor and at
least 20 for a body and tail carcinoma.9–11 The biologic rationale for
a disparate number of ELNs for head tumors, as opposed to body or
tail tumors, and accounts for such a broad range of minELN remains obscured. Taken in aggregate, undersampling of LNs remains
a potential error that may impact prognosis.
One alternative prognostic strategy proposed by Berger and
colleagues is using the positive lymph node ratio (LNR) as an
adjunct to AJCC N stage.12 Support has grown for an expanded
utilization of LNR to accurately characterize post-surgical
prognosis.11,13,14 LNR has proven to be a valuable indicator for
risk stratiﬁcation and survival prediction in a variety of malignancies, including gastric cancer, rectal cancer, esophageal
cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma.15–19 The role of the total
number of ELNs required to accurately characterize LNR needs
to be further investigated.
The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the impact of
the number of ELNs on the prognostic capacity of AJCC N
staging and LNR, and to identify the optimal value of minELN
using a novel modeling technique based upon the binomial
probability law. This approach is particularly well suited for use
in evaluating lymphatic metastases in cancer patients for three
core reasons. First, the pathologic evaluation of lymph nodes for
disease involvement can be viewed as a series of repeated investigations or tests (i.e. each node is evaluated separately).
Second, these repeated tests can have just two discrete outcomes
(i.e. metastases identiﬁed versus no metastases identiﬁed). Lastly,
the evaluation of each lymph node is done independently such
that the ﬁndings of one test (lymph node #1 for example) does
not impact the outcome for the next test (lymph node #2 is
evaluated independently). In this work, prospectively collected
histopathologic data are utilized alongside this modeling technique to derive a proposed minELN required for optimal histopathologic staging in PDAC. These techniques are applied in

HPB 2021, 23, 575–586

the context of optimizing minELN for accurate determination of
N stage and, separately, LNR.

Methods
Patient population and data source
Clinicopathologic data were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing pancreatectomy at Johns Hopkins Hospital
(JHH) between January 2000 and November 2018. Patients with
a ﬁnal diagnosis of PDAC were enrolled. Patients who received
neoadjuvant therapies before surgery were excluded as the
impact of neoadjuvant therapy on the prognostic value of LN
evaluation remains unclear and requires dedicated study.20
Demographic and clinical data including age, gender, medical
history (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia), and adjuvant chemotherapy were collected. Pathologic details included
tumor grade, presence of perineural or lymphovascular invasion,
margin status, examined positive lymph nodes, total ELN, and
tumor size.
Lymph node assessment and standard protocol
Surgical resection included en bloc extirpation of the locoregional draining lymph node basins. Pathologists dissected all
peripancreatic soft tissues and grossly identify lymph node
candidates to be submitted for histologic examination. As an
institutional standard, a second pathologist or pathology assistant was required to repeat the dissection of all available tissues if
fewer than 12 nodes were grossly identiﬁed by the ﬁrst. There
was no institutional standard deﬁning a maximal number of LN
candidates identiﬁed during the course of tissue dissection. Each
candidate node was ﬁxed, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic evaluation. Each node was
assessed for tumor spread and deﬁned as a positive node in the
event of ﬁnding adenocarcinoma cells, of any size or number,
within the identiﬁed nodal tissue.
Treatment strategy and follow-up
Patients enrolled in this study underwent a surgery-ﬁrst approach
to PDAC with perioperative outcome measures captured prospectively.21–23 Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were broadly
deﬁned as FOLFIRINOX or modiﬁed-FOLFIRINOX (5ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan), singleagent therapies (capecitabine or gemcitabine alone), or
gemcitabine-based regimens (predominately gemcitabine and
nab-paclitaxel). Oncologic outcomes were followed through July
2019. OS was calculated from the date of surgical operation. For
actuarial survival assessment, patients were censored at the last
follow-up date. The date of death was obtained from medical
records, local obituary search or the Social Security Death Index.
Statistical analysis
LNR was derived by dividing the total number of positive lymph
nodes by the number of ELNs. This ratio was expressed as the

probability of metastasis for each node (a value between zero and
one) and quartile classiﬁcation of LNR was performed to identify
unique points of inﬂection with X-tile (Yale University, New
Haven, CT, USA).24 The probability to detect at least one metastatic LN in a node-positive patient was modeled according to
the binomial probability law, formulated as11,25:
P = 1 − (1 − p)n

In this formula, p is the LNR value, n is the number of ELN
and P represents the probability of detecting at least 1 positive
lymph node in a node-positive patient. The minELN was then
deﬁned as the cutoff of LN yield consistent with a 95%
probability to detect at least 1 positive lymph node (P = 95%).
Kaplan –Meier survival curves were constructed using R
version 3.5.2 (Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ). Actuarial
differences were evaluated with log-rank testing. A Cox
proportional-hazards regression model was used for univariate
and multivariate analyses. Continuous variables were expressed
as medians and compared using the Mann–Whitney U test or
Kruskal –Wallis test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were
presented as frequencies and percentages, and analyzed by
Pearson Chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Receiver operating curves are created in R and interpreted
using an area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted in a 2-tailed analysis with a p value
<0.05.

Results
Patient characteristics and nodal status according to
updated AJCC guidelines
Over nearly two decades, 1837 patients met inclusion criteria.
The median age was 68 years (IQR 60–75) and 51.9% were male.
Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were common comorbid
medical conditions. Nodal stage (both AJCC and LNR) was
associated with the surgical procedure performed, tumor grade,
surgical margin, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion
and tumor size (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Patients
who underwent PD were more likely to have positive nodes,
higher N stage and a higher LNR stage than those who had distal
pancreatectomy (DP). The median number of ELN for the entire
cohort was 19 (IQR 14–26). In this surgery-ﬁrst cohort, lymph
node metastasis was common (76.3%). The median number of
ELNs in patients with positive lymph nodes was 20 and the
median number of positive nodes found per patient was 3. The
median number of ELNs in node-negative patients was 18
(p < 0.001).
An evaluation of N stage (AJCC 8th edition) demonstrates that
23.7% patients were classiﬁed as N0, 40.0% patients as N1 (1–3
nodal metastasis) and 36.3% patients as N2 (>3 nodal metastasis). Clinicopathologic features stratiﬁed by N staging are
presented in Supplementary Table 1. The number of ELNs was

HPB 2021, 23, 575–586

found to be higher for patients with N2 disease (21) versus N0
and N1 disease (18, p < 0.001). In this cohort, the median
number of positive nodes was 6 (IQR 5–9). These data support
the notion that patients with N2 disease typically have had a
greater number of ELNs.
Evaluating LNR as a method to reduce errors from
inadequate LN sampling
To mitigate the dependence of accurate LN staging on adequate
total ELN, some studies have suggested the use of LNR. In our
cohort, the median LNR was 0.118 (IQR 0.028–0.261). In the
node-positive patients, the median LNR in this study was 0.227.
Using X-tile, LNR was stratiﬁed into four subgroups with the
proposed nomenclature LNR0 (LNR = 0), LNR1
(0 < LNR  0.1), LNR2 (0.1 < LNR  0.3) and LNR3
(0.3 < LNR  1). The median number of ELNs across prognostic
subgroups varied signiﬁcantly from LNR0, 1, 2, to 3, with 18.0
(IQR 13.0–23.0), 23.0 (IQR 16.0–31.0), 20.0 (IQR 15.5–26.0)
and 17.0 (IQR 13.0–22.0), respectively. These data suggest that
undersampling of peripancreatic nodes, a proposed factor of N
stage migration in the AJCC system may similarly contribute to
LNR quartile groupings as well. The clinicopathologic characteristics according to LNR staging are displayed in
Supplementary Table 2.
Deﬁning a minimum number of ELN for appropriate
nodal staging
Applying the binomial probability function to discriminate between N0 and N1/N2 with 95% conﬁdence, the minELN needed
in PDAC specimens was 12 (binomial law calculation of 11.6).
When this theory was applied to a hypothetical patient with only
one metastatic node expected (and a LNR cutoff value of 0.1, i.e.
low burden metastases), the model suggests that the minimum
number of lymph nodes examined to reach a 95% probability of
detection was 29 (binomial law calculation 28.4). The discrepancy between the minELN to detect any positive node for the
average patient (12) and the minELN for a patient with only one
node expected to be positive (29) was driven by the signiﬁcant
number of patients found to have greater than one positive node.
In keeping with this model, as the predicted LNR increased to
0.3, reﬂecting poorer disease biology and more frequent detection of lymphatic spread, the number of ELNs to reach 95%
probability of accurate characterization decreased to 9 (binomial
law calculation 8.4).
Oncologic outcomes and cohorting based on ELN
thresholding
The median OS of the entire cohort was 21.0 months and the 1-,
3- and 5-year OS rates were 73.3%, 29.3%, and 16.3%, respectively. In patients with node negative disease, the median OS was
no different with fewer than 12 ELNs when compared to 12 or
more ELNs (35 v. 38 months). With node-positive disease, the
median OS of patients with less than 12 ELNs was signiﬁcantly

different to those with 12 or more ELNs (16 v. 19 months,
P = 0.015). N stage determination (N1 v. N2) was accurate in
stratifying oncologic outcomes even when ﬁnding fewer than 12
ELNs (19 v. 13 months, P = 0.036; Fig. 1a). The use of LNR in
this subgroup did not add prognostic value (Fig. 1b). As the
number of ELNs increase to 12 or more, the prognostic value of
N stage was maintained (Fig. 1c) and an additional prognostic

value emerges that supports LNR cohorting (Fig. 1d). When
prognostic value was assessed using an AUC analysis, the LNR
appears marginally superior to N stage (0.637 versus 0.621,
P < 0.001, Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). Notably here,
however, the AUC value failed to approach values typically seen
when optimal modeling thresholds are reached (typically 0.8 and
higher).

Prognostic value of nodal assessment and impact of
ELN
Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the AJCC
N stage and the proposed LNR staging guidelines were useful as
independent prognostic biomarkers for OS (Table 2,
Supplementary Fig. 2A–C). As guided by our analysis above, we
focused next on an evaluation of nodal staging systems as the
number of ELN reaches a threshold of 29. Similar to other
patient cohorts, the median OS of patients with nodal metastasis
was signiﬁcantly shorter than those without nodal metastasis (23
vs. 41 months, P < 0.001; Fig. 2a). The N stage subgrouping
maintained prognostic signiﬁcance in these high ELN patients
(Fig. 2b). The LNR proved to be similarly valuable in these high
ELN patients with median OS varying between 13 months for

LNR3 to 41 months in LNR0 (Fig. 2c). When evaluating prognostic capacity using the AUC model, the AJCC N slightly
outperformed LNR staging (Fig. 2d). Again here the AUC value
did not approach 0.8 or above.
When the number of ELNs was in the range of 9–29, the value
of LNR appeared marginally superior to AJCC N staging by AUC
analysis (Fig. 3a, values below 0.8). The superiority of the LNR
strategy was, however, driven by patients with relatively high
LNR burden. AJCC N stage cutoffs, for example, demonstrated a
median OS between 16, 23 and 35 months, for N2, N1 and N0
disease respectively (P < 0.001; Fig. 3b). When the LNR was
examined, the median OS between each LNR stage maintained
statistical signiﬁcance and provided additional prognostic data
for high LN positive patients (Fig. 3c).

When the number of ELN was 9 or fewer, the value of utilizing
LNR as an alternative to AJCC N stage was no longer maintained.
In this cohort, neither AJCC N stage (speciﬁcally with N1 and
N2, P = 0.139; Fig. 4a) nor LNR staging demonstrated statistical
signiﬁcance (Fig. 4b). Only lymph node status (positive or
negative) showed a signiﬁcant prognostic value (P = 0.003;
Fig. 4c).

Discussion
The prognostic value of lymph node metastases in resected
PDAC remains a cornerstone of histopathologic staging of each
patient’s disease.8,26,27 Nevertheless, the minELN required during

HPB 2021, 23, 575–586

pathologic evaluation to accurately characterize N stage of disease remains an area of debate. Most prior work, for example, has
focused on comparing AJCC N stage with LNR while noting
sampling bias as a limitation in the work. Herein, we utilize a
foundational concept of probability theory, the binomial probability law, to underpin a novel analysis of LN staging in PDAC
and address the limitations of prior work directly. Our data
conﬁrm that a larger number of ELNs is associated with an
increased N stage and support the notion that understaging may
be a source of stage migration in PDAC.
As work continues in efforts to ﬁnd consensus on minELN, the
effects of administering neoadjuvant therapies remains similarly
controversial. Arrington and colleagues reviewed their

experience in a mixed population, with some receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and concluded that 18 LNs were required to
capture 90% of cases with any nodal metastasis.28 This ﬁnding
exceeds the current recommendations and may be difﬁcult to
generalize to centers in which dedicated pancreatic pathologists
are not available. We have found that, in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy, 12 nodes are required according to binomial
probability modeling to accurately characterize AJCC N0 versus
N1/N2 in 95% of patients. This ﬁnding supports the College of
American Pathologists’ recommendation that a minimum of 12
lymph nodes should be sampled.29 Our data do suggest, however,
that understaging when 12 lymph nodes are examined may occur
in as many as one in twenty patients and identifying the patient
cohort with just one node positive may require more ELNs.
Similarly, our data suggest that the minELN may vary based
HPB 2021, 23, 575–586

upon the type of surgical resection performed. While as few as 12
ELN may be adequate for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, as many as 18 are modeled to be required in patients
undergoing distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The work
done here using this novel method conﬁrms prior retrospective
analysis suggesting the minELN is 12–15 in resected pancreatic
head carcinoma and as many as 20 in pancreatic body/tail
carcinoma.9,11
The use of LNR, as opposed to AJCC N stage, has been proposed as a tractable strategy to mitigate the inﬂuence of variable
ELN sampling on ﬁnal N stage assessment.30,31 Berger (12) and
Pawlik (32) each reported on the relative value of LNR as
prognostic biomarkers.12,32,33 Subsequent studies showed excellent discrimination of LNR in OS.8,34–36 Previously, we also reported that LNR could be pivotal prognostic predictor for

resected patients with an analysis of patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and
proposed a nomogram containing LNR as a superior prognostic
model with excellent performance in discrimination and risk
stratiﬁcation.7 The effect of total number of ELN on LNR,
however, is a concept that has not previously been investigated.
Herein we demonstrate that the minELN required when using a
LNR ratio approach is, in fact, greater than the number needed
to conﬁdently determine patients as AJCC Stage N1 (as opposed
to N0). When contemplating a change from the AJCC N stage
classiﬁcation to one based upon LNR, it is important to note that
the relative value of the proposed change is impacted by other
markers of prognosis such as surgical margin status, tumor size
(T-stage), tumor grade, and perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Thus, as the incidence of other poor prognostic features
increases the relative value of LNR over simple N stage determination may be diminished.37–39
Most prior work focused on the role of either AJCC N stage or
LNR in predicting survival with an eye towards generalization in
the absence of consensus regarding the minELN. We have utilized principles of binomial distribution to derive an optimal
minELN in both AJCC N staging and LNR determination. As
expected, the minELN value is dependent, in part, on the staging
system selected (AJCC N stage versus LNR) and the expected
LNR in a given population. The proposed LNR system is internally validated using our clinical cohort in an actuarial survival
analysis. Our ﬁndings suggest that LNR is superior to AJCC N
stage in discriminating survival after resection for PDAC in most
patients. This includes patients who have a large range of ELNs
(>9 but <29) on ﬁnal pathologic analysis. When the number of
ELN 29, the power of LNR staging was diminished when
compared to AJCC N stage, and when fewer than 9 LNs were
available for analysis, simple nodal status (N0 v. N1) may be the
better choice.
There are several notable limitations that are inherent to this
work. These data were analyzed retrospectively from a single
center’s prospectively collected database and are likely not generalizable to all cohorts. The time period over which these data were
collected, nearly two decades, also exposes the dataset to limitations with regards to the routine use and type of adjuvant chemotherapies administered. A multicenter, controlled, prospective
study may be required to ultimately conﬁrm these ﬁndings and
establish a prospectively derived value for minELN across the
population. The LNR values derived from our X-tile analysis may
not be applicable following neoadjuvant therapy. Owing to the
controversy in neoadjuvant therapy for resectable PDAC and
challenges in identifying a large number of lymph nodes in the
specimen after neoadjuvant therapy, another speciﬁc assessment
for PDAC patients with neoadjuvant therapy is ongoing. Importantly, the bias of both surgeons and pathologists in harvesting
LNs for assessment cannot be overcome in this retrospective work.
As an example, it may be appropriate to alter the LN harvest
performed during pathologic grossing based upon factors such as

HPB 2021, 23, 575–586

obvious and bulky lymphadenopathy versus those with microscopic nodal tissues. The generalizability of this approach is also
limited by the practical difﬁculty of reaching a cutoff of 12 ELNs in
many pancreatic specimens. This limitation appears to be greater
in patients who proceed to the operating room following neoadjuvant therapies and should be the focus of future work.
Finally, an additional assumption in this work was inherent to
the mathematical model utilized, namely, the assumption that
any lymph node has an equal probability of being positive as any
other for each speciﬁc patient. This assumption is contrary to the
principles established in several other disease sites (such as breast
cancer or melanoma) where the concept of a sentinel lymph
node carrying the greatest prognostic value has been validated.
Here we look to the current discussion in the literature, and in
practice, regarding the optimal surgical lymph node dissection
during pancreatectomy and the technical capacity to identify a
sentinel node in PDAC. First, in contrast to breast cancer, it does
not appear that sentinel node techniques would be a tractable
method to address the remaining questions that our computational model poses.40 As the modern high-volume surgical
setting matured, the performance of an extended lymphadenectomy in the retropancreatic soft tissues was found to be safe
but added no oncologic beneﬁt and is not currently recommended.41,9 Nevertheless, outcomes were not cohorted according to LN status in this retroperitoneal space. With modern
chemotherapeutics, nodal spread to the retroperitoneal tissues,
particularly station 16 nodes, appears to confer a particularly
poor prognosis.42 It remains to be seen if the indexed inclusion of
these nodes speciﬁcally, or others clearly outside the regional
nodes recommended by expert consensus, would alter our
analysis here.

Conclusion
Accurate characterization of nodal disease, whether AJCC N
stage designation or determination of a LNR, remains a
cornerstone of modern oncologic care and informs postsurgical
prognosis-based decision making. We present a novel approach
to modeling lymph node metastasis based upon the binomial
probability law in order to evaluate the frequency with which
patients may be understaged according to current guidelines in
patient care. In modeling the burden of disease in patients undergoing a surgery-ﬁrst approach, we have derived the minELN
required for accurate characterization of AJCC N stage in
resected PDAC. Twelve LNs are required, at a minimum, to
capture 95% of patients with N1 disease. As the number of ELNs
increased, the discriminatory capacity of alternative strategies to
characterize LN disease burden exceeded that offered by AJCC N
stage. Speciﬁcally, the LNR was a powerful prognostic staging
system when ELN value was between 9 and 29. When the ELN
count exceeded 29, the accuracy and performance of AJCC N
stage was marginally superior to LNR. When fewer than 9 LNs
were available for analysis, simple positive or negative LN status

was the better choice. Ultimately, these data support the current
recommendations from the College of American Pathologists
that 12 LNs are required for adequate nodal staging in PDAC.
Finally, this work lays out a method for derivation of minELN
that relies upon a probability-based algorithm. This model may
be utilized in future to derive the minELN value as the shift
towards neoadjuvant therapy continues and paradigms of clinical
care change.
