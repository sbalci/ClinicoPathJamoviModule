A Comparison of Liver Sampling Techniques in Dogs
S.D. Kemp, K.L. Zimmerman, D.L. Panciera, W.E. Monroe, M.S. Leib, and O.I. Lanz
Background: The liver sampling technique in dogs that consistently provides samples adequate for accurate
histopathologic interpretation is not known.
Hypothesis/Objectives: To compare histopathologic results of liver samples obtained by punch, cup, and 14 gauge
needle to large wedge samples collected at necropsy.
Animals: Seventy dogs undergoing necropsy.
Methods: Prospective study. Liver specimens were obtained from the left lateral liver lobe with an 8 mm punch, a
5 mm cup, and a 14 gauge needle. After sample acquisition, two larger tissue samples were collected near the center of the
left lateral lobe to be used as a histologic standard for comparison. Histopathologic features and numbers of portal triads
in each sample were recorded.
Results: The mean number of portal triads obtained by each sampling method were 2.9 in needle samples, 3.4 in cup
samples, 12 in punch samples, and 30.7 in the necropsy samples. The diagnoses in 66% of needle samples, 60% of cup
samples, and 69% of punch samples were in agreement with the necropsy samples, and these proportions were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other. The corresponding kappa coeﬃcients were 0.59 for needle biopsies, 0.52 for cup biopsies,
and 0.62 for punch biopsies.
Conclusion and Clinical Importance: The histopathologic interpretation of a liver sample in the dog is unlikely to vary
if the liver biopsy specimen contains at least 3–12 portal triads. However, in comparison large necropsy samples, the accuracy of all tested methods was relatively low.

istopathology of the liver provides information
about the cause, chronicity, and reversibility of
disease.1,2 However, reliable histopathologic results are
dependent upon a liver sample of adequate size and
quality.3,4 In humans, biopsy specimens containing
6–113,4 portal triads are recommended to ensure accurate interpretation. Samples with few portal triads or
those that fracture into multiple pieces are considered
inadequate.3–5 In dogs the minimum number of portal
triads necessary for accurate histopathologic interpretation is unknown.
The World Small Animal Veterinary Association
(WSAVA) Liver Standardization Group guidelines
suggest that needle biopsy is adequate and that surgical
liver biopsy is unnecessarily invasive.6 However, several
studies in dogs have questioned the accuracy of needle
biopsies.7–9 When histopathologic diagnoses obtained
with needle biopsies were compared to those obtained
in necropsy specimens in dogs, there was only 53%
agreement between samples.7 However, the size of the
biopsy instrument was not reported, nor was the quality of the samples. Another study demonstrated only a

48% agreement in histopathologic diagnosis between
18 gauge needle biopsies and surgical samples taken
from the same animal.8 Finally, other studies have
demonstrated that punch and cup liver biopsies were
shown to routinely produce samples with greater than
6–8 portal triads,9 while 18 gauge and 16 gauge needle
biopsy specimens produced fewer than 6 portal
triads.8,9
Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that is associated with risk. Hemorrhage from the biopsy site is
usually minimal but can be a potentially life threatening complication of any type of liver biopsy.9–12
Because diﬀerent methods of liver biopsy have dissimilar risks, morbidity, and cost, it is important to identify the biopsy technique that results in the most
accurate diagnosis with the least potential to harm the
patient.
Currently, the WSAVA Liver Standardization
Group recommends 14 gauge needle samples in most
dogs, with 16 gauge needles reserved for small
patients.6 The adequacy of samples obtained by this
method is unknown as previous studies have evaluated
smaller biopsy needles. Therefore, the primary goal of
this study was to compare postmortem liver samples
collected by 8 mm punch, 5 mm cup, and 14 gauge
needles and to identify the method that most consistently produced samples that represent the histopathology of the liver. We hypothesized that liver samples
obtained via punch, cup, and 14 gauge needle would
result in similar histopathologic diagnoses to those
found with large wedge samples of liver obtained at
necropsy.

This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Virginia Tech. This was a prospective
study of dogs presented to the necropsy service between May

Kemp et al

2011 and August 2012 at the Virginia-Maryland Regional
College of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Teaching Hospital
(VTH). All dogs were patients of the VTH that died or were
euthanized and written consent was obtained from all owners.
All samples were collected within 3 hours of death and by the
same investigator (SDK). For sample collection a midline
abdominal incision was made with a scalpel blade. After the
liver was visualized and exposed samples were collected from
the left lateral liver lobe in order to simulate sample collection
during percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy.6 All sample specimens were taken from near the center of the lobe,
within 5 cm of each other. Samples collected from each cadaver
included an 8 mm punch,a a 5 mm cup,b and a 14 gauge needlec sample. All techniques were performed in a manner that
simulated collection in living dog undergoing liver biopsy as
closely as possible. The punch sample was collected by advancing the cutting edge of a biopsy puncha at a 90° angle into the
surface of the liver parenchyma near the center of the left lateral lobe. The cup sample was collected by advancing the open
jaws of the cup biopsy forcepsb at a 90° angle into the surface
of the liver parenchyma near the center of the left lateral lobe.
The needle sample was collected with a semiautomatic biopsy
needlec by advancing the needle into the center of the left
lateral liver lobe at a 90° angle to the surface.
Test samples using each technique were collected until a nonfractured specimen that completely ﬁlled the sampling channel of
the instrument was obtained. The number of attempts required
to ﬁll the sampling channel was not recorded. After test sample
acquisition, two deep tissue samples of approximately
2 cm 9 2 cm 9 1 cm were taken from the left lateral lobe. These
large samples (designated “necropsy” samples in this manuscript)
were used as the standard for morphologic diagnosis and comparison with each test sample. A histopathologic diagnosis was
determined using the necropsy samples based on the WSAVA
Liver Standardization Group’s classiﬁcation of hepatic disorders.
If a focal liver lesion was noted (eg, mass or discoloration), the
procedures for obtaining test samples and necropsy samples were
repeated at the lesion site.
Tissue samples were placed in separate cassettes in the same
container and immediately ﬁxed in neutral-buﬀered 10% formalin at room temperature. After ﬁxation, samples were arranged in
paraﬃn cassettes for embedding and processing. Five micron
thick sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). Two-hundred eighty-four slides from 71 sample
sites were randomized and evaluated by a board certiﬁed veterinary pathologist (KZ), who was unaware of their hospital case
identity, for standardized evaluation as described below.
Samples were assigned a score for 16 histologic features8:
hepatocellular atrophy, hepatocellular hypertrophy, biliary hyperplasia, ceroid lipofuscin pigment, hemosiderin pigment, canalicular cholestasis, congestion, extramedullary hematopoiesis,
vacuolar change, ﬁbrosis, tissue inﬂammation, lobular collapse,
hepatocellular necrosis, neoplasia, thrombosis, and vascular
abnormalities. Scores were on a scale of 0–3 with 0 representing
no change and 3 representing severe change. Neoplasia was
assessed as present or absent.
Hepatocellular atrophy was identiﬁed by cords being closer
together, small hepatocytes, increased numbers of portal triads in
a given area, and a wrinkled capsule.13 Hepatocellular hypertrophy was deﬁned by the presence of hepatocytes of increased size
and increased cytoplasmic basophilia.13 Biliary hyperplasia was
scored on the basis of increased number of small biliary duct
proﬁles located within the portal triad areas.13 Ceroid lipofuscin
was deﬁned as a lightly golden-yellow, granular to globular,
hepatocellular cytoplasmic pigment.13 Hemosiderin was deﬁned
as a brown crystalline pigment within both hepatocytes and
Kupﬀer cells.13 Canalicular cholestasis was scored based on the

identiﬁcation of green bile plugs within the bile canaliculi.13
Congestion was diagnosed based on distention of hepatic sinusoids by erythrocytes.13 Extramedullary hematopoiesis was diagnosed when foci of hematopoietic precursors cells were identiﬁed
within the biopsy specimen.13 Vacuolar change was identiﬁed
based on the presence of swollen hepatocytes with cytoplasmic
vacuoles that were either distinct or indistinct, and, either single
or multiple, as well as those with ﬁnely reticulated cytosol.13
Fibrosis was diagnosed by a proliferation of ﬁbroblasts and collagen appreciable by hematoxylin and eosin stain.13 Tissue
inﬂammation was classiﬁed as acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis,
reactive hepatitis, and cholangiohepatitis. Acute hepatitis was
characterized as a combination of inﬂammatory cells with neutrophils in majority, hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis, with
or without regeneration.14 Chronic hepatitis was characterized by
a combination of hepatocellular apoptosis or necrosis with variable lymphoplasmacytic inﬁltration with or without a neutrophilic component, regeneration and ﬁbrosis.14 Reactive hepatitis was
characterized by neutrophilic or mixed inﬂammation in portal
areas and the hepatic parenchyma without necrosis.14 Cholangiohepatitis was characterized by neutrophilic, lymphocytic, or
mixed inﬂammation involving portal region hepatocytes as well
as bile ducts.14 Hepatocellular apoptosis was characterized by
shrunken hepatocytes, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and condensed nuclei surrounded by an empty halo.14 Lobular collapse
was diagnosed by loss of normal lobular architecture because of
loss of hepatocytes.13 Hepatocellular necrosis was diagnosed by
the presence of shrunken cells, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and
fragmented or pyknotic nuclei.14 Neoplasia was diagnosed by
identiﬁcation of atypical, dysplastic hepatic or metastatic cells in
the sample specimen.13 Thrombosis was identiﬁed by the presence
of thrombi within hepatic vasculature.13 Vascular abnormalities
were scored based on identiﬁcation of small or absent portal
veins, arteriolar proliferation, with or without hepatocellular
atrophy.13 Cirrhosis was characterized by bridging ﬁbrosis with
conversion of normal architecture into structurally abnormal
regenerative nodules, and the presence of portal-central vascular
anastomosis as a diﬀuse change.14 Regeneration was identiﬁed
when hyperplasia was present, particularly in a nodular pattern
accompanied by ﬁbrosis. The criteria scores of the two necropsy
samples were averaged and served as the standard to which the
other samples were compared.
Based on the histologic criteria scores, a morphological diagnosis was assigned to each of the 4 specimens (three test methods
and necropsy sample) based on the WSAVA Liver Standardization Group guidelines.15 Only histologic criteria scores ≥2 were
considered as part of the ﬁnal morphologic diagnosis. The morphologic diagnosis assigned to the necropsy samples was considered the deﬁnitive diagnosis. If the morphologic diagnoses from
the two necropsy samples from the same liver did not agree, all
specimens from that dog were censored from further analysis.
Finally, the number of portal triads present in each sample was
recorded. The basis for enumerating a portal triad was the identiﬁcation of all three triad structures (hepatic artery, portal vein,
and bile duct).

Statistical Analysis
Agreement between deﬁnitive morphologic diagnosis and the
morphologic diagnosis of the test specimens were assessed by calculating kappa coeﬃcients. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of each
sample type as compared to the necropsy samples was calculated.
In these calculations, the same predominant histopathologic
abnormality in the test sample and the necropsy sample was considered a true positive. Comparison between the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity for the 3 sampling methods was tested using the
Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test. The proportions of concordant

sample results were compared with logistic generalized estimating
equations (GEE) analysis. The mean number of portal triads
between sample types was compared with a mixed model
ANOVA. The mean score for each of the 16 histologic features
was calculated for all samples of each test sample type and compared using a linear GEE analysis to detect signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the histologic characteristics between test samples and necropsy samples. All analyses were performed using commercial
software.d Signiﬁcance was determined at P < .05.

Results
Seventy dogs and 71 total sample sites (one dog had
a focal lesion) were included in this study. No cases
were censored because of disagreement between the
two necropsy samples. Morphologic diagnoses in the
necropsy samples were: no abnormality (18/71;
25.4%), vacuolar hepatopathy (18/71; 25.4%), neoplasia (8/71; 11.3%), primary ﬁbrosis (6/71; 8.45%),
chronic hepatitis (5/71; 7.0%), congestion (5/71;
7.0%), cirrhosis (5/71; 7.0%), necrosis (3/71; 4.2%),
cholangiohepatitis (1/71; 1.4%), reactive hepatitis (1/
71; 1.4%), and cholestasis (1/71; 1.4%).
There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences (P = .29) in the
proportion of test samples that agreed with the necropsy sample between test sample types. Cohen’s
kappa coeﬃcient for the needle, cup, and punch samples were 0.59, 0.52, and 0.62 respectively.
The mean number and 95% conﬁdence intervals of
portal triads in each sampling method was 2.9 (2.6–3.2)
in needle samples, 3.4 (2.7–4.2) in cup samples, 12.0
(10.3–13.7) in punch samples, and 30.7 (27.0–34.5) in
the necropsy samples. Punch samples had signiﬁcantly
more portal triads than either cup or needle samples
(P < .001) which were not statistically diﬀerent from
each other (P = .98). The necropsy samples had signiﬁcantly more portal triads than all the test samples
(P < .001). The number of portal triads could not be
determined in 8 needle samples (diagnosis included neoplasia [4], cirrhosis [2], ﬁbrosis [1], necrosis [1]), 11 cup
samples (diagnosis included neoplasia [5], cirrhosis [3],
necrosis [2], ﬁbrosis [1]), 12 punch samples (diagnosis
included neoplasia [5], cirrhosis [4], acute hepatitis [1],
ﬁbrosis [1], necrosis [1]), and 13 necropsy samples (diagnosis included neoplasia [5], cirrhosis [4], ﬁbrosis [1],
necrosis [1], chronic hepatitis [1], and congestion [1]),
because of loss of normal hepatic architecture.

53

The sensitivities and 95% conﬁdence intervals of the
test methods as compared to the necropsy samples
were similar, being 60% (46–73%), 55% (41–68%),
and 66% (52–78%) for needle, cup, and punch sampling, respectively. The speciﬁcities were also similar
between methods and were higher than the sensitivities, being 83% (58–96%), 78% (52–93%), and 78%
(52–93%) for needle, cup, and punch sampling respectively. When the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of each test
method was calculated for each diagnosis, the highest
sensitivities were found in dogs with vacuolar hepatopathy, normal hepatic histopathology, and neoplasia
(Table 1). Within each diagnosis category where sensitivity and speciﬁcity were reported, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the sensitivities or speciﬁcities
between the test types. Results were not reported for
necrosis, cholangiohepatitis, reactive hepatitis, or cholestasis because of the small number of cases in each
category. Diagnoses in the 8 livers with neoplasia
included histiocytic sarcoma (3), lymphoma (3), undifferentiated round cell sarcoma (1), and spindle cell sarcoma (1). The sensitivity for diagnosis of neoplasia
was 75% (95% CI: 0.45–1.0) for needle samples; 63%
(95% CI: 0.29–0.96) for cup samples; and 88% (95%
CI: 0.65–1.0) for punch samples. The speciﬁcity for
neoplasia was 100% in all three test types. Overall, the
sensitivity for the diagnosis of ﬁbrosis was low, ranging from 16 to 50% (Table 1).
The mean scores for each of the histologic features
were compared amongst the test sample types and several signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the necropsy samples
were identiﬁed (Table 2). The needle samples identiﬁed
signiﬁcantly less hepatocellular atrophy, biliary hyperplasia, hemosiderin, and congestion compared to the
necropsy samples. The cup samples identiﬁed signiﬁcantly less biliary hyperplasia, hemosiderin, and congestion when compared to the necropsy samples.
Finally, the punch samples showed signiﬁcantly less
hepatocellular hypertrophy and hemosiderin than the
necropsy samples.
In the 6 cases with a predominant histopathologic
abnormality of ﬁbrosis, the mean ﬁbrosis score in the
necropsy samples was 2.5, which was signiﬁcantly
higher than 1.5 in the punch (P = .014), 1.4 in the cup
samples (P = .014), and 0.5 in the needle samples
(P < .001). In the 5 cases of chronic hepatitis the mean

Kemp et al

Results of this study indicate that 14 gauge needle,
5 mm cup, and 8 mm punch samples of the liver have
a similar proportion of samples in agreement to larger
hepatic samples. However, the level of agreement
could be considered insuﬃcient when a single sample
is taken by any tested technique. The disparity
between the test samples and the necropsy samples
seemingly occurs as a result of variable distribution of
morphologic features within a liver lobe which might
be overcome by obtaining multiple samples, a larger
single sample, or perhaps biopsies from multiple lobes.
The paired necropsy samples from each dog had identical histopathologic diagnoses, while the smaller samples obtained using the three test methods had less
consistent agreement with the large necropsy samples.
Because all the samples were obtained within 5 cm of
each other, the size of the specimen obtained by the
test methods was most likely the primary factor inﬂuencing the histopathologic interpretation.
Smaller test samples had fewer portal triads. The
number of portal triads in the needle and cup samples
were not diﬀerent, and both contained fewer than
what is recommended in humans, while the punch
samples exceeded the minimum recommendations.3,4
Despite this, the accuracy of the punch samples was
not greater than the other test methods. Therefore,
recommendations for sampling the human liver do not
appear to be applicable to dogs.
The median and mean number of portal triads of 3
and 2.9, respectively, in needle samples in the present
study was lower than previous reports where 18 gauge
needle biopsies had a median of 4 portal triads8 and
16 gauge needle samples had a mean of 6–7.9 portal
triads.9 This discrepancy may be attributable to the
strict criteria used for counting portal triads in this
study, where all 3 structures comprising the portal
triad had to be clearly identiﬁed. Other studies that
did not describe their methodology in detail may have
included portal areas without all three components of
the triad visible. Despite the punch samples containing
signiﬁcantly more triads than the other test methods,
the overall histopathological agreement with necropsy
samples was not diﬀerent. Therefore, when the number
of portal triads in samples ranges from 3 to 12, the
ﬁnal histopathologic interpretation is unlikely to vary.
However, because of the relatively poor agreement
with the necropsy samples, it is reasonable to assume
that biopsies larger than those obtained in this study
might enhance the likelihood of a correct diagnosis.
Because techniques used to obtain larger biopsies
might result in increased risk for hemorrhage, multiple
biopsies from diﬀerent locations of a lobe might be the
best method to safely acquire adequate tissue.

Portal triads could not be reported in 13 (18%) of
the necropsy samples because of severe distortion in
the hepatic architecture. This raises concern for the use
of portal triad numbers as the only measure of biopsy
specimen quality, as these samples were large but did
not contain recognizable triad structures. However, the
diagnoses in the majority of these cases were neoplasia
or cirrhosis and it is likely that in such severe disease
large samples with many portal triads may not be necessary for diagnosis.
In this group, the sensitivity of needle samples were
similar to a previous report that compared 18 gauge
needle and surgical biopsies.8 While the sensitivity for
detection of hepatic neoplasia was similar to that of
another study (80%) using a smaller needle biopsy, the
speciﬁcity was 100% in all sample methods tested in
the present study.8 Because the majority of neoplasms
in our population were systemic, it is unclear if similar
results would be found in dogs with focal, metastatic,
or multifocal neoplasia.16
In cases where ﬁbrosis was the histopathologic diagnosis, all three sampling methods had a signiﬁcantly
lower mean ﬁbrosis score than the necropsy samples. In
these cases the punch and cup samples had a concordant
diagnosis in 3 samples, and only 1 of the 6 livers with
ﬁbrosis had it identiﬁed on needle biopsy. These ﬁndings
suggest that large tissue samples may be necessary to
accurately describe the degree of ﬁbrosis when severe
disease is present. This is in contrast with previous studies where needle biopsy specimens showed higher histologic scores for ﬁbrosis.8 However, the results of the
present study mirror those of several human studies in
which ﬁbrosis scores declined with smaller biopsy
size.5,17 The discordance in the ﬁbrosis scoring is likely
caused by variation in severity of ﬁbrosis throughout or
between lobes, which has been documented in humans.
In a report of patients with primary biliary ﬁbrosis,
whole section scanning of the liver at the time of transplantation revealed that only 20% of these livers had
ﬁbrosis throughout the entire organ.18
All test methods were insensitive for diagnosis of
chronic hepatitis, unlike a previous study that reported
needle biopsies had higher scores for inﬂammation
when compared to wedge biopsies obtained at surgery.8 In the present study, there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the histologic scores for inﬂammation
between the sampling methods. However, when the
ﬁve cases of chronic hepatitis were analyzed separately,
inﬂammation scores for both the cup and needle samples were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the necropsy
samples. The punch and cup samples both had concordant diagnoses in 2 cases and the needle samples had
concordant diagnoses in 3 cases. Although the number
of cases in the present study was limited, the results
suggest that histopathology of a single sample may underrepresent the severity of disease when chronic
inﬂammation is present. This ﬁnding is similar to a
report in humans which demonstrated that shorter
needle biopsies produced samples with lower inﬂammatory scores in patients with hepatitis C virus infection.4 However, it is not known if the lower histologic

scores for inﬂammation reported in the small test samples in the present study would result in a diﬀerent
clinical diagnosis in dogs.
The high number of discordant samples amongst all
test methods may be attributable to nonuniform
lesions throughout the liver lobe, even in diﬀuse hepatopathies. For example, marked variation in copper
concentration was found when needle biopsy specimens were compared to wedge samples in dogs.19 Conclusions of the small number of studies that have
evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of liver biopsy techniques in dogs have been hampered by limitations in
our understanding of canine liver disease. Studies evaluating liver biopsy in humans typically focus on
patients with a speciﬁc disease such as hepatitis C virus
or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and are aimed to
deﬁne the best biopsy method for that speciﬁc disease,
whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.5,20
Because of limited knowledge of the etiology and clinical markers of speciﬁc liver diseases in dogs, any
biopsy technique must be able to identify any of the
histologic features that might be present.
One limitation of this study is reliance on a single
pathologist for interpretation of all of the liver samples.
However, use of a single pathologist likely resulted in
more consistent results between cases, compared with
multiple observers.21 The expertise of the pathologist in
evaluating the liver is another important consideration
in humans and likely is important in veterinary medicine as well.22 Dogs enrolled in the study were not
selected because of known hepatic disease, thus were
not representative of the population in which liver
biopsies would be obtained in clinical practice. The
inﬂuence that a higher prevalence of hepatic disease
would have had on the results of this study remains
unclear. It is important to note that in a study of liver
biopsy in population of patients where biopsy was
deemed appropriate for clinical reasons, 28% had no
hepatic disease, similar to the 26% in the present
study.8 Sample collection was performed using methods
that mimicked their antemortem use, but diﬀered from
percutaneous and laparoscopic biopsy as the samples
were obtained through a large abdominal incision and
repeated sampling was attempted until a suﬃcient sample was retrieved. The number of attempts required to
obtain a sample that ﬁlled the biopsy instrument was
not recorded, but the size of antemortem biopsies varies
within a given method and fragmented samples complicate histopathologic interpretation.9 In addition, sample acquisition can be aﬀected by the underlying liver
disease. For example, in the authors’ experience, needle
or cup sampling of a severely ﬁbrotic liver often results
in smaller biopsies and frequently multiple attempts are
necessary to obtain an adequate sample. Biopsies
obtained in a clinical setting might be of lower quality
and be limited by the potential for complications of
repeated sampling. Thus, it is possible that the accuracy
of nonsurgical biopsies in clinical cases may be lower
than reported here.

recommends two biopsies for histopathologic

evaluation, the present study might have been strengthened by evaluating more than one sample using each
test method. However, our study was not designed to
determine the minimum number of samples necessary to
ensure accurate histopathologic diagnosis, rather it was
to investigate the ability of commonly used sampling
methods to accurately reﬂect the histopathologic diagnosis. Sample quality in the present study was controlled by using only samples that fully ﬁlled the
instrument’s chamber and were not fragmented, resulting in uniform comparisons between sampling methods
and avoiding the inﬂuence of variation in biopsy size
which has been shown to aﬀect biopsy interpretation in
humans with hepatitis.4 Because no sampling method
had a strong agreement with the gold standard, it seems
clear that multiple samples should be obtained in the
hope that it would improve accuracy. It is likely that the
number of samples necessary for an accurate histopathologic interpretation would vary depending on the disease and biopsy quality. Histochemical staining was
limited to H&E in the present study, which may have
led to underestimation of ﬁbrosis, limited assessment of
architectural changes in some diseases, and prevented
identiﬁcation of some intracellular contents and pigments. However, the same stains and analytic criteria
were applied to each sample, so the detrimental eﬀects
of using a single stain would be limited. Future studies
should address these important issues.
Our study design limited the surgical samples to one
technique that allowed for sampling from the center of
the lobe. Other methods of surgical liver biopsy have
been described in the dog,9 and it is possible that an
alternate method of sampling such as obtaining a larger wedge from the edge of a liver lobe might improve
accuracy.
The results of this study demonstrate substantial
limitations in the accuracy of a single liver sample by
any of the tested techniques. Obtaining multiple samples from the liver might be of greater importance than
the method of biopsy.
