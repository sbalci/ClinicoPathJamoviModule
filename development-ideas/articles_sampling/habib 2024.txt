Running Title: Lymphadenectomy in IPMN-derived PDAC
ABSTRACT

Objective: To establish minimal and optimal lymphadenectomy thresholds for intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
evaluate their prognostic value.
Background: Current guidelines recommend a minimum of 12-15 lymph nodes (LNs) in PDAC.
This is largely based on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)-derived PDAC, a
biologically distinct entity from IPMN-derived PDAC.

Methods: Multicenter retrospective study including consecutive patients undergoing upfront
surgery for IPMN-derived PDAC was conducted. The minimum cut-off for lymphadenectomy
was defined as the maximum number of LNs where a significant node positivity difference was
observed. Maximally selected log-rank statistic was used to derive the optimal lymphadenectomy

D

cut-off (maximize survival). Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to analyze
overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Multivariable Cox-regression was used

TE

to determine hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).

Results: In 341 patients with resected IPMN-derived PDAC, the minimum number of LNs
needed to ensure accurate nodal staging was 10 (p=0.040), whereas ≥20 LNs was the optimal

EP

number associated with improved OS (80.3 vs. 37.2 months, p<0.001). Optimal
lymphadenectomy was associated with improved OS [HR:0.57 (95%CI 0.39-0.83)] and RFS
[HR:0.70 (95%CI 0.51-0.97)] on multivariable Cox-regression. On sub-analysis the optimal
lymphadenectomy cut-offs for pancreatoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and total

C

pancreatectomy were 20 (p<0.001), 23 (p=0.160), and 25 (p=0.008).
Conclusion: In IPMN-derived PDAC, lymphadenectomy with at least 10 lymph nodes mitigates

AC

under-staging, and at least 20 lymph nodes is associated with the improved survival. Specifically,
for pancreatoduodenectomy and total pancreatectomy, 20 and 25 lymph nodes were the optimal
cut-offs.

INTRODUCTION
The poor survival associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is largely driven by
the high prevalence of advanced stage at diagnosis as well as a predisposition for local and
systemic disease progression even after surgical resection.1, 2 Several clinicopathologic are

D

associated with recurrence and survival outcomes, improving risk stratification, and guiding
personalized therapy decisions.3, 4 Of these, disease in the regional lymph nodes consistently

TE

demonstrates a strong relationship with survival outcomes, as demonstrated by the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.5

Surgical oncologic quality metrics emphasize adequate lymphadenectomy to prevent under-

EP

staging and ensure clearance of locoregional disease.6 Lymph node ratio (LNR), defined as the
ratio of positive lymph nodes to total examined lymph nodes, has also been well established as
an independent prognostic factor among PDAC patients.7 Moreover, an increasing number of
harvested lymph nodes is associated with a greater likelihood of node positivity, implying a

C

potential stage migration, and with improved survival.8, 9 As such, an adequate
lymphadenectomy in patients with PDAC may provide therapeutic benefits in addition to more

AC

accurate staging.

Reports vary on the minimum number of lymph nodes for adequate staging. Examination of 12
lymph nodes may be sufficient for accurate AJCC staging for PDAC.10 Alternatively, the

International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) recommends harvesting and
examining at least 15 lymph nodes for adequate staging. The ISGPS also highlighted the
prognostic importance of lymph node ratio (LNR), which is impacted by both number of positive
and harvested lymph nodes.11 However, existing studies do not distinguish between the more
common pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)-derived PDACs and intraductal papillary

mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-derived PDAC. Furthermore, considering the growing
understanding of differences in biology, disease course, and outcomes between PanIN-derived
and IPMN-derived PDAC, a different number of lymph nodes may be appropriate for accurate
staging and prognostication in patients with IPMN-derived PDAC.12, 13 This multi-institutional

D

study aims to investigate and derive the recommended minimal and optimal number of lymph

TE

nodes to be harvested in IPMN-derived PDAC as well as their prognostic value.

METHODS
Study Population

EP

Patients with histologically confirmed IPMN-derived PDAC after surgical resection with
available data between 2000 and 2021 were identified from four high-volume international
centers including the Amsterdam University Medical Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, New York
University Langone Health, and the Regional Academic Cancer Center Utrecht.

C

Exclusion criteria included concomitant PDAC separate from an adjacent IPMN, gross
positive resection margin (R2), missing number of nodes harvested, stage IV disease at

AC

diagnosis, and 90-day postoperative mortality. All participating centers obtained local
institutional review board approval. The strengthening and reporting of observational studies in
epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were used and the study complied with the 1964 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments.14

Pathologic Assessment
Pathologists with an expertise in pancreas confirmed histology - invasive carcinoma
arising from an IPMN and not a concomitant PDAC lesion. The AJCC TNM system 8th edition

was used for staging.5 Microscopic evidence of invasive cancer at or within 1 millimeter of the
resection margin was defined as R1. LNR was calculated as the number of positive lymph nodes
divided by the number of lymph nodes harvested.

D

Statistical Analysis
The recommended minimum cut-off for lymph nodes harvested was defined by the maximum

TE

number of lymph nodes harvested where a significant difference between node positivity was
observed (stage migration) using a χ2 or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. A maximally
selected log-rank statistic, analogous to the lowest p-value method, was used to derive the

EP

optimal number of lymph nodes examined for overall survival (OS).15 Subsequently, patients
were stratified according to optimal and suboptimal number of harvested lymph nodes, based on
the established cut-off. Categorical variables were displayed as counts and percentages and
compared using a χ2 or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. Continuous variables were

C

described as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using a Mann-Whitney U test.
OS was defined as time between surgical resection and date of death. Recurrence-free survival

AC

(RFS) was defined as time between surgical resection and death or recurrence, whichever came
first. Patients were censored at the time of last known follow-up visit documented if no event
occurred. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for all time-to-event analyses, and these were
used to derive median OS and RFS with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Log-rank tests were used
to compare Kaplan-Meier curves of the overall and stratified cohorts. A backwards selection
multivariable Cox-regression analysis, initially including all clinicopathologic factors (age, sex,
CA19-9, type of surgery, year of surgery, margin, T-stage, N-stage, optimal lymphadenectomy,
histologic subtype, grade, perineural and lymphovascular invasion, and adjuvant chemotherapy),

was utilized to select the combination of variables that were most predictive of OS. Additional
analysis was performed to investigate the role of LNR (a variable that is representative of both
nodal disease and extent of lymphadenectomy) and its impact on OS and RFS. Results were
presented as hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% CI. A sub-analysis was then performed

D

by separating patients based on operation: pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), distal pancreatectomy
(DP), and total pancreatectomy (TP). Optimal and suboptimal lymphadenectomy cohorts were

TE

redefined and analyzed using PD and TP patients based on the newly derived significant cut-offs.
A p-value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed
using the "R" statistical software (version 4.2.3) using the “MaxStat”, “survminer”, “survival”,

Overall, 341 patients with resected IPMN-derived PDAC were included (Table 1, supplement

AC

Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLA/F75). Of these, 189 (55%)
were male and 257 (75%) were 65 years or older. Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) was performed
in 209 (61%) patients, while distal pancreatectomy (DP) and total pancreatectomy (TP) were
performed in 74 (22%) and 58 (17%) patients, respectively. Furthermore, 192 (56%), 80 (23%),
and 69 (20%) patients had N0, N1, and N2 disease, respectively. The median number of positive
and harvested lymph nodes was 0 (IQR: 0-3) and 19 (IQR: 14-27), respectively. Adjuvant
chemotherapy was administered in 49% of patients, of which 81% were treated with
Gemcitabine based regimens. The median number of adjuvant chemotherapy cycles was 6 (IQR:
4-6). Median follow-up for all surviving patients was 40.3 months (IQR: 17.4-72.3).

Derivation of a Minimal Cut-off to Forego Inadequate Staging
A cut-off of 10 nodes examined was determined to be the minimum number of lymph nodes
(p=0.040) that should be harvested for accurate pathological staging. Patients with <10 lymph

nodes examined had significantly less nodal disease [node negative: n=17 (77%) and node
positive: n=5 (23%)] compared to patients with ≥10 lymph nodes examined [node negative:

significant stage migration was observed.

TE

n=175, (55%) and node positive: n=144 (45%)]. Beyond 10 lymph nodes harvested, no

Based on tumor size, a significant increase in nodal positivity was observed with

EP

increasing tumor size [(<1cm: 91% N0 vs 1-2cm: 66% N0, P=0.009), and (1-2cm: 66% N0 vs 23cm: 31% N0, p=0.003)]. Beyond 2cm, no difference in the rate of nodal positivity was
observed.

C

Derivation of an Optimal Cut-off

A cut-off of 20 harvested lymph nodes was the optimal cut-off based on survival benefit

AC

(Figure 1, p<0.001), which was achieved in 160 out of 341 (47%) patients. Comparisons of
baseline characteristics for optimal lymphadenectomy (≥20 harvested lymph nodes) versus
suboptimal lymphadenectomy (<20 harvested lymph nodes) are presented in Table 1. Briefly,
total pancreatectomy was more common in the optimal lymphadenectomy group (24% vs. 10%,

p<0.001). Furthermore, tubular subtype was more common in the suboptimal lymphadenectomy
group (84% vs. 71%, p=0.014). There was no difference in American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (p=0.268), usage of the minimally invasive approach (9% vs.
11%, p=0.576), rate of vascular resections (6% vs. 13%, p=0.100), postoperative complications

(40% vs. 49%, p=0.110), receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (54% vs. 45%, p=0.089), or number
of cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (6 vs 6, p=0.694), while operation duration (mean: 373 vs.
332 minutes, p=0.019) was longer in patients receiving an optimal lymphadenectomy compared

D

to those with a suboptimal lymphadenectomy.

Survival and Recurrence Outcomes by Optimal Lymphadenectomy

TE

The median OS was 52.5 months (95%CI: 42.8-77.4), while the median RFS was 27.8
months (95%CI: 21.6-35.9). Median OS in the optimal lymphadenectomy group was 80.3
months (95%CI: 66.3-116.0) compared to 37.2 months (95%CI: 29.8-52.5) in the suboptimal

EP

lymphadenectomy group (p<0.001) (Figure 2A). Median RFS in the optimal lymphadenectomy
group was 35.0 months (95%CI: 23.1-50.2) compared to 24.1 months (95%CI: 17.0-33.8
months) in the suboptimal lymphadenectomy group (p=0.067) (Figure 2B). The distribution of
first site of recurrence was locoregional in 29% and 34%, peritoneal in 17% and 11%, systemic

C

in 40% and 36%, while 14% and 19% had multiple sites involved after optimal and suboptimal
lymphadenectomy, respectively (p=0.615).

AC

Amongst patients with node negative disease, median OS in the optimal lymphadenectomy
group was 113.9 months (95%CI: 93.9-159.0) compared to 85.5 months (95%CI: 67.1-122.0) in

the suboptimal group (p=0.140) with a median RFS of 79.9 months (95%CI: 45.2-107.7) and
67.0 months (95%CI: 35.9-97.2 months, p=0.250). Amongst patients with node negative disease,
locoregional recurrence was observed in 9% of the optimal lymphadenectomy group compared
to 18% in the suboptimal group (p=0.053). No difference was observed in systemic (13% vs.
12%, p=0.870), or peritoneal recurrence (8% vs. 8%, p=0.886).

Amongst patients with node positive disease, median OS in the optimal
lymphadenectomy group was 44.5 months (95%CI: 25-77.2) compared to 20.1 months (95%CI:
16.3-27.0) in the suboptimal group (p<0.001) while the difference in RFS was not significant
(median RFS 16.1 months (95%CI: 12.0-19.8) vs. 14.0 months (95%CI: 11.6-16.9, p=0.156).

D

Also, there were no significant differences observed for site-specific recurrence rates:
locoregional (22% vs. 21%, p=0.807), systemic (30% vs. 37%, p=0.386), and peritoneal (9% vs.

TE

9%, p=0.928).

On pairwise comparisons, patients with N0 disease and a suboptimal lymphadenectomy
had similar survival compared to those with an optimal lymphadenectomy and N1 disease

EP

(p=0.223). Additionally, patients with N1 disease and a suboptimal lymphadenectomy had
similar survival compared to those with N2 disease and an optimal lymphadenectomy (p=0.181).

Multivariable Regression for Overall and Recurrence-free Survival
Multivariable Cox-regression analysis showed that optimal lymphadenectomy was

associated with improved OS [HR: 0.57 (0.39-0.83), p=0.003] and RFS [HR: 0.70 (0.51-0.97),
p=0.031]. Other variables that were associated with OS/RFS in the final model included age,
CA19-9, N-stage, perineural invasion, and adjuvant chemotherapy (Figures 3 and 4). Margin
status was only significantly associated with RFS. The Harrell’s C statistics for the OS and RFS
models were 0.76 and 0.73 respectively.

Additional analysis showed that an increase of 0.1 in LNR was independently associated
with worse OS [HR: 1.28 (1.15-1.43), p<0.001] and RFS [HR: 1.40 (1.27-1.54), p<0.001]. Other
variables that were associated with OS and RFS in the final model included age, CA19-9,
margin, N-stage, perineural invasion, and adjuvant chemotherapy (Supplement Figures 3,

D

Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLA/F75 and 4, Supplemental Digital

including LNR were 0.75 and 0.74, respectively.

On sub-analysis for surgical approach, the optimal lymphadenectomy cut-off for PD

EP

remained 20 (p<0.001), which was achieved in 95 of 209 (45%) patients undergoing PD. For
patients undergoing DP, the optimal cut-off was 23, however, the difference in OS did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.160). The optimal cut-off for patients undergoing a TP was 25

(p=0.008), with 28 of the 58 (48%) patients receiving an optimal lymphadenectomy.
In PD and TP patients, where a statistically significant cut-off was detected (n=267,

AC

excluding DP), baseline characteristics of optimal (n=123) and suboptimal (n=144)
lymphadenectomy are presented in supplement Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/SLA/F75. No differences in minimally invasive approach (p=0.410),
vascular resections (p=0.357), duration of operation (p=0.092) or postoperative complications
(p=0.356) were observed.
Median OS in the optimal lymphadenectomy group was 93.9 months (95%CI: 70.3134.9) compared to 30.3 months (95%CI: 24.0-42.7) in the suboptimal lymphadenectomy group
(p<0.001) (supplement Figure 5A, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/SLA/F75). Median RFS in the optimal lymphadenectomy group was 41.9

months (95%CI: 27.3-77.2 months) compared to 20.1 months (95%CI: 15.2-29.5 months) in the
suboptimal lymphadenectomy group (p=0.002) (supplement Figure 5B, Supplemental Digital

Amongst node negative patients, median OS in the optimal lymphadenectomy group was

126.0 months (95%CI: 93.9-200.8) compared to 100.4 months (95%CI: 66.5-124.1) in the
suboptimal group (p=0.119) with a median RFS of 98.3 months (95%CI: 52.1-134.9) and 67.1

TE

months (95%CI: 35.4-100.4 months, p=0.101). However, locoregional recurrence was observed
less often in the optimal lymphadenectomy group compared to the suboptimal group (6% vs.
19%, p=0.015). The rate of R1 margins within these cohorts similar (p=0.356). There was no

difference in systemic (11% vs. 9%, p=0.722), or peritoneal recurrence (7% vs. 4%, p=0.488).
Amongst patients with node positive disease, median OS in the optimal
lymphadenectomy group was 44.5 months (95%CI:25.0-171.8) compared to 17.4 months
(95%CI: 16.1-24.0) in the suboptimal group (p<0.001).While there was an associated benefit in

RFS with optimal lymphadenectomy (median RFS 15.7 months (95%CI:11.5-27.1) vs. 11.7

specific recurrence rates: locoregional (24% vs. 25%, p=0.889), systemic (31% vs. 36%,
p=0.579), and peritoneal (12% vs. 6%, p=0.321).
Multivariable Cox-regression analysis on the operation stratified cohorts again validated

that optimal lymphadenectomy was associated with improved OS [HR: 0.56 (0.37-0.85),
p=0.007, supplement Figure 6, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLA/F75]
and RFS [HR: 0.59 (0.41-0.86), p=0.006, supplement Figure 7, Supplemental Digital Content 1,

and 0.75 respectively.

DISCUSSION
This first international study focusing on lymphadenectomy in IPMN-derived PDAC determined
that a minimum number of 10 lymph nodes should be harvested to prevent under-staging of

D

nodal disease. Furthermore, the optimal number of harvested lymph nodes needed to maximize
survival after pancreatectomy is 20. Particularly, the optimal cut-offs for patients undergoing

TE

pancreatoduodenectomy was 20 and while it was 25 for total pancreatectomy. Accordingly, we
demonstrated that an optimal lymphadenectomy is a robust independent predictor of overall and
recurrence-free survival in IPMN-derived PDAC.

EP

Adequate lymphadenectomy is essential for both accurate prognostication when guiding
post-operative treatment decision-making and patient counseling and to ensure an adequate
oncologic surgical resection. This is especially relevant for IPMN-derived PDAC, since

C

detection of nodal disease is an important determinate for the need for adjuvant chemotherapy.16
Currently, for PDAC, guidelines recommend harvesting at least 12-15 lymph nodes.5, 11

AC

However, the presence of nodal disease in IPMN-derived PDAC is less common than in PanINderived PDAC, and these two cancers are in fact molecularly different entities.12, 17 Herein, we
aimed to determine a minimal and optimal cut-off for lymphadenectomy unique to patients with
IPMN-derived PDAC. Numerous studies have investigated and attempted to identify an optimal
number of nodes that should be resected in PanIN-derived PDAC.18-22 Javed et al. recommended
a higher cut-off of 22 lymph nodes in patients who were treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.19 The proportion of patients with node positive disease in IPMN-derived PDAC
is more similar to those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (40%).23 Accordingly, our study
recommends a cut-off of 20 lymph nodes for pancreatoduodenectomy and 25 lymph nodes for

total pancreatectomy, which is higher than the cut-offs recommended by ISGPS and AJCC.5, 11
One study employing the Surveillance and Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database
found a cut-off of 16 nodes being associated with improved survival in IPMN-derived PDAC in
both node positive and negative patients.24 Although identifying patients with IPMN-derived

D

PDAC using national databases is not very reliable, our study is more similar to their higher cutoff. However, we found that additional nodes are further associated with improved survival and

TE

the present study further differentiated recommendations based on the type of operation.
Like the present study, an increasing number of lymph nodes analyzed has been
independently prognostic of improved survival in multiple gastrointestinal malignancies

EP

including colon, rectal, pancreas, and esophageal.9, 25-27 The rationalization for this finding is
debatable. Le Voyer et al. hypothesized that the surgeon may be a variable impacting
outcomes.25 A surgeon who harvests more lymph nodes performs a more complete excision,
possibly removing micrometastatic disease, and is expected to perform a better oncologic

C

resection which may impact survival.25 This theory is supported by improved pancreatectomy
outcomes at high volume centers with more experienced surgeons.28 Moreover, among node

AC

negative patients in the operation stratified cohorts, those with a suboptimal number of harvested
lymph nodes were more likely to suffer from local disease recurrence compared to those with an
optimal lymphadenectomy. This may be explained by improved clearance of disease in the local
surgical bed. Although no significant difference was seen in the location of recurrences for node
positive patients, an optimal lymphadenectomy in this cohort did significantly extend recurrencefree survival. However, a balance must be found, since an overly aggressive lymphadenectomy
has been shown to increase morbidity in one randomized trial.29 So, an optimum curve probably
exists. However, in the present study, postoperative morbidity was similar between the two

cohorts suggesting that an improved oncologic resection may be achieved without impediment of
surgical safety with the suggested cut-offs.
A second explanation for improved survival in node negative patients with more
harvested nodes is the likelihood of identifying a positive node increases as more nodes are

D

examined. Our study supports a stage migration at a cut-off of 10 nodes harvested as
demonstrated by a higher proportion of nodal disease detected in patients with ≥10 lymph nodes

TE

examined compared to those with <10 lymph nodes. Wu et al. also comment on a stage
migration noted with increased nodes harvested in the SEER database.24 Our study recommends
a minimum of 10 nodes to be harvested to prevent under-staging of disease. Furthermore, on

EP

pairwise comparisons, we found that node negative patients with suboptimal lymphadenectomy
exhibited similar survival compared to those with N1 disease and optimal number of lymph
nodes harvested. Moreover, patients with N1 disease suboptimal lymphadenectomy had similar
survival compared to those with N2 disease and optimal lymphadenectomy. This may further

C

underscore a degree of under-staging in N0 and N1 patients with suboptimal number of lymph
nodes harvested (inclusive of those with less than 10 nodes harvested) since their survival

AC

outcomes are not different than N1 and N2 patients with an optimal number of lymph nodes
harvested.

This study also found LNR, which is a function of both nodal disease and lymphadenectomy, to
be a robust and independent predictor of OS and RFS. A binational study between Massachusetts
General Hospital and Verona University on 104 patients with IPMN-derived PDAC also reported
similar findings observing 5-year RFS rates in patients with LNR = 0, >0 - ≤0.2, and >0.2 of
86.5%, 34.4%, and 11.1%, respectively.30 The robustness of LNR as a factor associated with

outcomes is also well documented in PanIN-derived PDAC.6, 22 Collectively, in both IPMN and

PanIN-derived PDAC, lymphadenectomy up to a certain threshold, which directly impacts LNR,
appears to have diagnostic and prognostic significance.
Several limitations in the present study should be acknowledged. First, the study period
was relatively long and changes in treatment strategies and patient management may have

D

existed. However, this was done to ensure a large study population since a major challenge in
investigating IPMNs is their infrequency. Additionally, the years included were not different

TE

between the optimal and suboptimal cut-off cohorts. Second, this study involved four
international centers where different surgical and pathologic examination practices such as
number of examined lymph nodes may be present. Although this may support the

EP

generalizability of our findings, future studies should validate these results in a different cohort
of patients and further explore the role of resection of specific lymph node stations. Currently, a
large proportion of patients undergo resection for an IPMN and are not found to have an invasive
component, and hence may not need a minimal or optimal lymphadenectomy. Future

C

investigations on more accurately predicting or assessing for an invasive component (such as
intraoperative frozen sections) can help inform the need for a more radical lymphadenectomy.

AC

Our study did note an increasing likelihood of nodal positivity in tumors approaching 2cm which
may help inform extent of lymphadenectomy. Finally, a strength of the current study is the
breakdown of optimal lymphadenectomy based on operation where lymph node yields are
different as expected. However, an optimal cut-off was not observed in patients undergoing
distal pancreatectomy and future studies should investigate this cohort of patients.

CONCLUSION
This international study determined that a minimum of 10 lymph nodes should be harvested to
prevent under-staging of nodal disease in IPMN-derived PDAC. Furthermore, we demonstrated

D

that the number of harvested nodes is a robust independent predictor of overall and recurrence
free survival. Accordingly, the optimal number of harvested lymph nodes needed to maximize

TE

survival is 20. In patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, this cut-off remained 20, however
25 lymph nodes were associated with the greatest improvement in survival for patients
undergoing total pancreatectomy, which is more than what is currently recommended for PanIN-

EP

derived PDAC. The findings of this study could help establish guidelines specific to the

AC

C

management of IPMN-derived PDAC.
