Abstract
Background: The minimum number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) required for adequate staging and best prediction of survival has
not been established in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of ELN on
staging and survival in PDAC.
Methods: Patients undergoing partial or total pancreatectomy for PDAC at two European university hospitals between 2007 and 2018
were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate Cox regression model and survival analyses were performed to verify adequate staging.
Results: Overall 341 (73 per cent) patients showed lymph node metastasis (N1/N2), whereas 125 (27 per cent) patients had no lymph
node involvement (N0). With increasing number of ELN, the proportion of positive lymph nodes increased. The minimum number
of ELN needed to detect lymph node involvement was 21. In multivariate analysis, examination of <21 lymph nodes was a
significant negative predictor for survival. Examination of ≥21 ELN reversed this effect and ruled out possible misclassification.
Conclusion: The number of ELN affects survival in PDAC. Possible misclassification was identified when <21 lymph nodes were
examined. Therefore, at least 21 lymph nodes must be examined to avoid false lymph node classification in all types of resection.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an early metastatic tumour
and remains one of the most lethal malignancies1,2. Surgical
resection with lymphadenectomy provides the only chance for
cure. Lymph node (LN) metastases are common and appear in
around 60–90 per cent of all resected patients3,4. In node-negative
patients, a median survival of 25–30 months can be achieved,
whereas in node-positive patients the median survival decreases
to around 15 months4–6. Several studies have demonstrated that
the number of positive lymph nodes influences survival3,7,5.
Various randomized controlled trials showed that extended
lymphadenectomy does not generate any survival benefit
compared to standard regional lymphadenectomy8–10. The
number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) might particularly be
influenced by variations in lymph node dissection, individual
surgeon skills, the gross pathologist expertise, the anatomic
constitution of each patient, and neoadjuvant treatment. With
the standardization of operation technique, the variation in the
number of ELN should theoretically not be pronounced. Due to
the fact that not all resected lymph nodes are always examined,
it could lead to a misclassification of N status because positive

LN can be overlooked. It was also shown that the number of ELN
and not only the involved LN is a prognostic factor for survival
in patients after distal pancreatectomy11.
There is no clear consensus on the minimum number of ELN
needed for adequate staging in pancreatic resections for
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Several studies
reported numbers varying between 11 and 28 required lymph
nodes3,5,11–16.
The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of
ELN on staging and survival in all different types of pancreatic
resection and to identify the minimum number of ELN needed
for the best prediction of survival in pancreatic cancer.

performed with the log-rank test and depicted as Kaplan–Meier
curves with the number at risk. An adjusted Cox proportional
hazard model with overall survival as a dependent variable was
employed for multivariate analysis of prognostic factors with 95 per
cent c.i. For correlation analysis, Spearman’s correlation coefficient
was used. The model of the binomial probability law was used for
the calculation to detect at least one lymph node metastasis with a
probability of 95 per cent. It was calculated according to the
following mathematical formula: P = 1 − (1 − lymph node
ratio)examined lymph nodes, as described previously15. Continuous
variables were expressed as median and minimum–maximum.
Categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentage
and compared with Chi2-test/Fisher’s exact test. All tests were
two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

Results
Demographic and histopathological
characteristics
Overall, 466 patients who underwent upfront pancreatic resection
due to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at the two hospitals were
included in the study. Overall, 309 (66.3 per cent) patients received
pancreaticoduodenectomy, 84 (18.0 per cent) patients distal
pancreatectomy and 73 (15.7 per cent) patients total
pancreatectomy for macroscopically complete (R0/R1) tumour
resection. The median number of ELN and the median number of
positive LN were 23 (i.q.r. 15) and 2 (i.q.r. 5) in
pancreaticoduodenectomy, 17 (i.q.r. 12) and 1 (i.q.r. 3) in distal
pancreatectomy and 25 (i.q.r. 15) and 2 (i.q.r. 4) in total
pancreatectomy. Overall, 125 (27 per cent) patients had no
histological evidence of lymph node metastasis (N0 status),
whereas in 186 (40 per cent) patients 1–3 positive LN were detected
(N1 status), and in 155 (33 per cent) patients more than 3 LN had
tumour metastasis (N2 status). The median follow-up of the study
cohort was 62.9 months (i.q.r. 46.3) for surviving patients and 16.8
months (i.q.r. 19.3) for deceased patients. The median overall
survival of all patients was 22.7 months (i.q.r. 39.1). In patients
without lymph node metastasis (N0), the median survival was 52.3
months (i.q.r. 110.4), whereas in patients with lymph node
metastasis the survival was significantly worse with 19.8 months
(N1) (i.q.r. 26.8) and 16.5 months (N2) (i.q.r. 21.2) (P < 0.001). The
demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of all
patients are outlined in Table 1 (stratified by type of resection) and
in Table 2 (stratified by lymph node status). The differences in the
study cohorts between centres are shown in Table 3. The survival
curves according to the lymph node yield did not differ among
centres (Fig. S1).

were included in the study. All patients were identified from a
prospectively maintained pancreatic cancer database containing
standard demographic, clinical, operative and pathological data.
The institutional review board (IRB) approved the prospective data
collection with retrospective data review for the study (Ethics
Committee Approval No.: 2022-438-S-NP).
In all patients, a primary curative resection was performed
depending on the localization of the tumour, that is
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), distal pancreatectomy (DP), or
total pancreatectomy (TP) with standard lymphadenectomy.
Patients with organ metastasis diagnosed during resection (M1),
macroscopically incomplete resection (R2 status), neoadjuvant
treatment and complication-related postoperative death (≤30
days) were excluded from the study for avoiding bias in the
survival analyses (Fig. 1). R0 status was defined as ≥1 mm
tumour-free resection margin.
Overall survival was defined as the time from resection of the
tumour to death. Lymph node ratio is calculated with the
number of affected lymph nodes divided by the total number of
lymph nodes removed. In the pathological report, the latest (8th)
edition of the TNM classification of the AJCC was used.

The study cohort was classified into four different groups according
to the amount of ELN (group I: < 10 ELN; group II: 10–19 ELN; group
III: 20–29 ELN; group IV: ≥ 30 ELN). Concerning all patients, the

After splitting the cohort based on the type of resection the
trend towards a higher proportion of lymph node metastasis
with increasing number of ELN persisted (Fig. 2b–d).
Amount of ELN correlated significantly with positive LN

Fig. 2 Distribution of the number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) on nodal status
Patients were categorized into four groups according to the number of ELN (I: <10 ELN; II: 10-19 ELN; III: 20-29 ELN; IV: ≥30 ELN) and analysed for each type of
resection (a–d). Correlation analysis of examined lymph nodes and positive lymph nodes with Spearman’s correlation (e).

in patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy, 0.06 after distal
pancreatectomy and 0.06 after total pancreatectomy. To detect
at least one positive lymph node with a probability of 95 per
cent, a minimum ELN of 21 was needed in all patients, 20 in
pancreaticoduodenectomy, 25 in distal pancreatectomy and 22
for total pancreatectomy.

Impact of nodal staging on survival
To find a cut-off value that prevents misclassification, the calculated
minimum number of ELN needed to detect one positive LN was
analysed for its impact on survival. In all patients, the median
overall survival did not show significant differences when <21 LN
were examined compared to ELN of ≥21 (Fig. 3a–c) (P = 0.10).

Discussion
The present study highlighted the importance of adequate lymph
node dissection and examination in pancreatic cancer surgery.
One of the most important findings was that with increasing
number of ELN, the proportion of LN metastasis increased. From
these results, it was concluded that patients with a low number of
ELN are often falsely classified in the N-category, which leads to
‘understaging’ of these patients. In other words, patients classified
as N0 are in fact N1, and N1 patients are actually N2 if more LN
were removed and examined. A valid prognosis for these patients

could have been achieved by more accurate and extensive
lymph node sampling. Because lymphadenectomy is supposed to
be a standardized procedure, the pathological lymph node
examination was probably insufficient. Misclassification can
either be caused by inadequate lymphadenectomy, or by
insufficient histological examination. Further categorization and
analysis
of
misclassification
would
require
histologic
re-evaluation of the resected specimen.
Multivariate analysis of the main factors influencing survival
(including tumour size18, surgical resection margin17, pathological
grading19 and lymph nodes status5) was used to evaluate a cut-off
value of ELN to prevent misclassification. In the adjusted
regression model, the examination of <21 LN was a negative
predictor for overall survival. Therefore examining at least 21 LN
in pancreatic resection prevents possible misclassification and
can be seen as the best cut-off point.
Lymph node status is also dependent on the experience of
the surgeon. Higher median LN count has been reported in
high-volume centres20. Pathological assessment and identification
of lymph nodes in the resected tissue is necessary and it depends
on the pathologist’s expertise. Larger LN are less likely to be
missed, as a lymph node about 4 mm in diameter can be palpable
and easily identified. Complete embedding of the fatty tissue in
addition can help to increase the number of ELN and was shown
to influence nodal staging in oesophageal adenocarcinoma21. The
amount of resected LN may also be influenced by the patient’s
individual constitution. Autopsy studies revealed different
numbers of regional LN with individual differences in LN amount
in gastric cancer22,23. It is also known that overweight and high
BMI hampers lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer24.
Several studies addressed the role of lymph node examination on
survival in pancreatic cancer. In this study the highest median
examined lymph node count was collected and all different types
of pancreatic resection were considered. Hellan and coworkers12
postulated in a study with 1915 node-negative patients that more
than 10 LN should be examined for improved survival, but the
median number of ELN in the study was 7, which is relatively low
compared to 22 LN in the present cohort. A study by Slidell et al.13
with 1507 node-negative patients proposed that more than 12 LN
should be examined to avoid misclassification with a median ELN
of 7 LN. Both studies included patients from 1988 to 2003 where
quality of lymphadenectomy and histopathological assessment
were different than today. Tomlinson et al.14 concluded from a
study with 3505 patients that the examination of at least 15 LN is
optimal for accurate staging in pancreatic cancer but reported only
a median ELN of 7.
The statistical calculation of the minimum number of ELN
needed to detect at least one possible LN using the binominal law
has been carried out before. For pancreaticoduodenectomy,

Univariate and multivariate analysis with Cox regression model
was performed including the most affecting factors17–19 for overall
survival in pancreatic cancer to analyse the impact of 21 ELN on
survival (Tables 4, 5). After adjusting with the other variables, Cox
regression analysis showed that the examination of <21 lymph
nodes was a significant negative predictor for overall survival (HR
1.27, 95 per cent c.i. 1.02–1.58, P = 0.034). The best cut-off value of
ELN was determined when ELN had no significant impact on
survival. Interestingly, the examination of <22 LN was not
significant in the multivariate analysis (HR 1.23, 95 per cent c.i.
0.99–1.60, P = 0.061). The most influencing factor for worsening
overall survival in this cohort was lymph node involvement with
N1 status (HR 2.14, 95 per cent c.i. (1.59–2.86), P < 0.001) and N2
status (HR 2.57, 95 per cent c.i. (1.88–3.51), P < 0.001). The
multivariate analysis was also performed separately for each
lymph node status (N0, N1 and N2) without any differences (Table S1).

LN for distal pancreatectomy. Taking into account that previous
studies have a lower median ELN, the present paper will serve as a
reference for the minimum needed number of 21 LN for adequate
staging. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
suggests the examination of ≥15 LN in pancreaticoduodenectomy
as recommended by the International Study Group on Pancreatic
Surgery (ISGPS)25. In the recently updated German S3-Guideline on
the treatment of pancreatic cancer (AWMF), the minimum
number of ELN needed to classify as N0 was increased to 12 LN26.
The study had several limitations. Due to its retrospective
nature, the study was limited by lack of some clinical data and
by the impossibility of reassessing all the histological specimens
with specific focus on lymph node examination. No data were
available on disease-free survival, CA19-9 levels and peri- and
vascular invasion. Patients with neoadjuvant treatment were
excluded from the final analysis. Neoadjuvant therapy was not
the standard treatment during the study period and contained
several different treatment protocols.
After splitting the study cohort according to different resection
types, there were no significant survival differences detected,
probably due to the small number of subgroups.
Standardized lymph node resection and systematic, careful
pathological assessment are needed for accurate staging and
achieving the best outcome for PDAC patients. From these
results, at least a minimum of 21 lymph nodes are needed for
adequate examination in all PDAC patients to avoid
misclassification of N0 and N1 status by surgical or pathological
reasons. This number has to be evaluated in different study
cohorts to confirm the results. A uniform recommendation for a
minimum need of ELN can improve the comparability of
patients and thereby improve survival in the long term.
