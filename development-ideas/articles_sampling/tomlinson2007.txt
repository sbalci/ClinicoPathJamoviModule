Objective: To determine the optimal number of
lymph nodes to examine for accurate staging of nodenegative pancreatic adenocarcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
Design, Setting, and Patients: Data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results program (1988-2002) were used to identify
3505 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, including 1150
patients who were pathologically node negative (pN0)
and 584 patients with a single positive node (pN1a). Perioperative deaths were excluded. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed.
Main Outcome Measure: Examination of 15 lymph
nodes appears to be optimal for accurate staging of nodenegative adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
Results: The number of nodes examined ranged from
1 to 54 (median, 7 examined nodes). Univariate survival analysis demonstrated that dichotomizing the pN0
cohort on 15 or more examined lymph nodes resulted

in the most statistically significant survival difference (logrank ␹2 =14.49). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a median survival difference of 8 months (P⬍.001)
in favor of the patients who had 15 or more examined
nodes compared with patients with fewer than 15 examined nodes. Multivariate analysis validated that having
15 or more examined nodes was a statistically significant predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.80; P⬍ .0001). Furthermore, a
multivariate model based on the survival benefit of each
additional node evaluated in the pN0 cohort demonstrated only a marginal survival benefit for analysis of more
than 15 nodes. Approximately 90% of the pN1a cohort
was identified with examination of 15 nodes.
Conclusions: Examination of 15 lymph nodes appears

to be optimal to accurately stage node-negative adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Furthermore, evaluation of at least 15 lymph nodes
of a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen may serve as a
quality measure in the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Improved knowledge regarding natural
history will provide the essential background for the design of trials and ultimately a more precise assessment of

pared with patients found to have metastatic disease to
regional lymph nodes. In other gastrointestinal epithelial malignancies, specifically gastric and colon cancers,
much work has investigated the minimum number of
nodes necessary for evaluation to accurately stage nodenegative cancers.13-16 With respect to pancreas cancer,
Brennan et al7 introduced evidence that the number of
negative nodes examined impacted prognosis in the recently validated nomogram for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.17 To our knowledge, no study has sought
to develop this concept with respect to accurate staging
of node-negative adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
In this study, population-based data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) program from 1988 to 2002 were
used to identify a large cohort of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of
the pancreas.18 Using overall survival as our end point,
we sought to determine the optimal number of nodes necessary to accurately stage node-negative disease.
METHODS

DATA
Data obtained from the SEER national cancer registry from 1988
to 2002 were evaluated through structured queries. The SEER
program collects patient records from multiple sites across the
United States and is considered the standard for quality among
cancer registries around the world. This national program includes 13 regional registries that cover approximately 26% of
the US population. The database was designed to reflect the overall characteristics of the United States, including the spectrum
of racial/ethnic groups, geographic locations, and types of cities and states.

PATIENTS
The SEER database extraction was performed by first identifying cases of pancreatic cancer as defined by the primary site variable (25.0, 25.1, 25.3-25.9). Adenocarcinoma cases were selected using histopathology codes as defined by the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology third edition19 codes for
adenocarcinomas (8000, 8001, 8003, 8010, 8012, 8020, 8021,
8022, 8030, 8031, 8033, 8035, 8041, 8045, 8046, 8050, 8070,
8140, 8141, 8144, 8154, 8201, 8210, 8230, 8260, 8290, 8310,
8440, 8441, 8450, 8452, 8453, 8460, 8470, 8471, 8472, 8473,
8480, 8481, 8482, 8490, 8500, 8501, 8503, 8550, 8560). Data
from patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy were
then extracted using primary site treatment variables. Cases pathologically staged as node negative (pN0) and single-node positive (pN1a) were identified using the extent-of-disease variables.6 Patients with more than 1 positive node as well as patients
who experienced 30-day postoperative mortality were excluded
from further analysis. Tumor T stage was also assigned using SEER
extent-of-disease variables in accordance with AJCC staging sixth
edition.20 Demographic information recorded for each patient included age, sex, race, and/or ethnicity (white, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska native, and other).

LYMPH NODE CUT POINT
AND SURVIVAL ANALYSIS
We determined the number of lymph nodes examined for both
the pN0 and pN1a cohorts, including range and frequency. Four

separate analyses were performed to determine the optimal number of nodes to examine after pancreaticoduodenectomy for exocrine cancer of the pancreas. First, an unadjusted univariate
survival analysis was performed based on lymph node cut points
(LNCPs) ranging from 2 to 25. Lymph node cut point was defined as whether a threshold number of lymph nodes had been
examined. This allowed the introduction of the number of lymph
nodes examined into analysis as a dichotomous variable. For
example, an LNCP of 15 divides the pN0 cohort into a group
of patients with fewer than 15 lymph nodes examined and a
group with 15 or more lymph nodes examined. Overall survival was measured from the date of surgery to the date of death
or last follow-up. The pN0 cohort was dichotomized with respect to each LNCP, and a pair of Kaplan-Meier survival curves
was generated. Log-rank comparison was then performed on
each pair of survival curves to determine the most statistically
significant survival difference based on maximization of the logrank ␹² statistic.13,21
To validate the significant results from our univariate survival analysis, the second analysis performed was a multivariate
Cox proportional hazard regression with overall survival as the
dependent variable.22 Independent variables included in the model
were age, sex, T stage, and the number of lymph nodes examined as a dichotomous variable defined as the LNCP. The third
analysis was a similar Cox proportional hazard regression; however, the number of lymph nodes examined was entered as a continuous independent variable in an attempt to define the survival benefit associated with each additional node examined. Given
the skewed frequency of the number of nodes examined, a logarithmic transformation of this continuous variable was required.
To obtain a clinically meaningful interpretation of this regression, we predicted the survival benefit associated with each additional node examined. In predicting the likelihood of survival
between 2 patients with a differing number of nodes examined,
the individual predicted hazard ratios (HRs) were subtracted.
Finally, the fourth analysis recorded the actual number of nodes
examined in the pN1a cohort to discover a single positive node.
The pN1a cohort was chosen for analysis because it represents
the cohort with the smallest burden of nodal metastases. We limited our analysis of this cohort to strictly determining the number of nodes examined to identify the single positive node. By
plotting the number of nodes examined against the cumulative
frequency of patients within this cohort, the number of examined nodes necessary to identify 90% of these patients with a single
positive node was obtained. Of note, we specifically did not analyze survival within this cohort or any other node-positive cohort to avoid the confounding and putative arguments regarding any therapeutic effect of the extent of lymphadenectomy. Our
study only analyzed survival within the node-negative cohort,
which should negate any proposed therapeutic effect due to differences in the extent of lymphadenectomy. In other words, removal of more negative nodes should not have a therapeutic effect.
Data were analyzed using Stata statistical software version
9 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). Statistical significance
was set at Pⱕ.05.
RESULTS

Using SEER data from 1988 to 2002, more than 3500 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were identified. The descriptive characteristics are listed in Table 1. Median
age was 64.4 years and 49.3% of the patients were female.
Using AJCC/UICC sixth edition staging guidelines, approximately 70% of the resected tumors were T3. Thirtythree percent of the cohort were pathologically staged as

node negative (pN0), and 60% of all node-positive patients had only a single node positive for metastatic disease, classified as pN1a disease according to the UICC staging guidelines.

Figure 1). The median number of lymph nodes examined was 7, with a range of 1 to 54 examined nodes.
In our first analysis, log-rank comparison of univariate Kaplan-Meier survival curves was performed for each
LNCP (2-25 LNCPs) and demonstrated superior survival always in favor of the group with more nodes examined. Table 2 shows these results for representative
LNCPs of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 examined nodes. An LNCP
of 15 resulted in the most significant survival difference
with the largest ␹2 statistic (14.49) and associated P value
(P =.0001). The resulting Kaplan-Meier survival curves
based on an LNCP of 15 are shown in Figure 2. The
median survival for the group of patients with pN0 disease who had 15 or more nodes examined was 27 months,
whereas the median survival for the group who had fewer
than 15 nodes examined was 19 months. The difference
in median survival between these two groups was 8
months (P =.001).
The second analysis, a Cox hazard regression, was performed to validate our univariate findings in a multivariate model. An LNCP of 15 was entered into a multivariate model along with T stage, age, and sex. The results
demonstrate that the LNCP of 15 is a strong independent
predictor of survival as evidenced by an HR of 0.63 (95%
confidence interval, 0.49-0.80; P⬍.0001) (Table 3).
In the third analysis, the Cox regression used the same
variables as the prior regression but the number of nodes
examined was entered as a continuous variable. The HR
for the lymph node variable was 0.88 (95% confidence
interval, 0.81-0.95; P=.002). Using this HR of 0.88 as the
proportional survival benefit of each additional node examined, a predictive model was constructed. Figure 3
depicts the predicted HR plotted against the number of
nodes examined relative to a patient with pN0 disease
with 1 node examined. Using this model, the propor-

15 nodes examined, the relative HR of 0.71 would indicate that the patient who had 15 nodes examined would
have roughly a 30% increased likelihood of surviving. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3, the predicted survival
benefit becomes progressively smaller with an increasing number of nodes examined. If we compare a patient
who had 15 nodes examined with a patient who had 20
nodes examined, the model predicts only a 3% increased likelihood of survival based on the difference between predicted HRs.
ANALYSIS OF THE pN1a COHORT
The fourth analysis evaluated a cohort of patients who
had only a single lymph node reported as positive, which
corresponds to pN1a disease as defined by UICC sixth
edition staging guidelines. Figure 4 plots the number
of nodes examined against the cumulative percentage of
patients in the pN1a cohort and shows that approximately 90% of all single-positive-node disease was found
after evaluation of 15 or fewer nodes.

cer. Analogous to studies in gastric and colon cancer, our
findings indicate that there is an improved survival associated with an increasing number of examined nodes
within a cohort of pathologically staged node-negative
patients. While some may argue that the survival benefit resulted from a more extensive surgical resection, this
line of reasoning does not apply in a patient with truly
node-negative disease. In other words, removing more
negative nodes from a patient with truly node-negative
disease should not provide any therapeutic benefit. Thus,
the superior survival experienced after examination of
more nodes is due to the understaging of patients with a
suboptimal number of lymph nodes examined.
The number of lymph nodes examined after resection
of pancreatic cancer depends on many factors, including
type of specimen, extent of surgery, regional nodes present in a given individual, and technique of the pathologist
who examines the specimen. We have limited our analysis to include only pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens
to control for some of these factors, specifically the type
of specimen and, to some degree, the extent of surgery.
In our attempt to determine an optimal number of nodes
to examine to accurately stage node-negative pancreatic cancer after a pancreaticoduodenectomy, we used 4 separate
but related analyses: (1) survival analysis based on LNCPs;
(2) validation of univariate survival results with multivariate Cox regression; (3) multivariate predictive modeling;
and (4) determination of the number of nodes examined
to identify 90% of the cohort with a single positive node.
Univariate analysis demonstrated that the most statistically significant improvement in survival occurred
using an LNCP of 15. Similarly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the LNCP of 15 was a strong and independent predictor of improved survival, also in favor of
15 or more nodes evaluated. Furthermore, multivariate
analysis using the number of nodes examined as a continuous variable allowed for the construction of a model
predicting the incremental survival benefit associated with
each additional node examined. Applying this model, we
have shown that examination of more than 15 nodes provides only a marginal increase in the likelihood of survival. Finally, this point is strengthened on consideration that the vast majority of pN1a disease is found after
examination of 15 lymph nodes.
The statistical data described earlier appear to converge on 15 as the optimal number of lymph nodes to
examine to accurately stage pN0 disease. However, a practical issue is raised as to whether the examination of 15
lymph nodes is achievable in the majority of pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens. In a publication by the Royal
College of Pathologists23 outlining standards in the histopathologic analysis of exocrine tumors of the pancreas, it is stated that 10 to 20 nodes should be available
for examination within a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen. A large series of resected pancreatic cancers from
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center showed that the
median number of nodes examined was 15.7 Data from
a randomized controlled trial from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions by Yeo et al3 revealed a mean of 16 lymph
nodes examined from the pancreaticoduodenectomy
specimens. Of note, 86% of pancreaticoduodenectomies in this series were pylorus preserving. Similarly, in

Figure 4. Number of lymph nodes examined in the cohort with a single
positive node (pN1a). This curve demonstrates that approximately 90%
of patients with a single positive node were discovered with examination
of 15 nodes.

a recent report by Berger et al24 from Fox Chase Cancer
Center, the median number of nodes examined was 17.
Given that these numbers were achieved in the absence
of any benchmark or specific pathologic guidelines, it
seems reasonable that retrieving 15 lymph nodes from a
pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen is not only important but also achievable.
At present, improving the quality of cancer care is a
focal point of many national organizations. Quality measures and guidelines are being developed and public reporting is already being performed. While further rigorous work is probably needed in this regard, it is essential
that meaningful measures that will allow for evaluation
of cancer care and outcome are identified and developed. To this end, our work has identified that evaluating 15 lymph nodes in a node-negative pancreatic carcinoma resection may be considered a quality indicator
because it is associated with improved survival as a result of more accurate staging. With respect to potential
as a quality measure, there would be much room for clinical improvement, as the median number of nodes retrieved in this SEER sample was 7 and the percentage of
cases that did retrieve 15 or more nodes was only 19%.
This is probably an important quality issue in that there
is a suboptimal number of nodes examined in more than
80% of patients staged as pN0. Having a criterion for the
number of nodes reported is not new, as numerous guidelines have purported that 12 nodes be examined in a nodenegative colon cancer specimen to truly deem the patient node negative.25,26 Moreover, the National Quality
Forum is currently discussing the adoption of this measure for accountability—which could potentially transform into a pay-for-performance measure. The current
work may contribute to the body of literature for developing quality measures in pancreatic cancer.
Our study has several potential limitations. First, as
with any large database there could be miscoding and inaccurate data, although the SEER program upholds several measures to ensure accuracy and maintains the highest level of certification of data quality and completeness.
A second limitation is that the SEER program lacks in-

formation about potentially important clinicopathologic factors. Specifically, the SEER program does not provide data on patient comorbidities, margin status, and
details regarding adjuvant therapy. Finally, we have limited our analysis to only include cancers of the pancreatic head to standardize the type of specimen for pathologic examination. There are 2 primary types of
pancreaticoduodenectomies performed, pylorus preserving and standard, which involves removal of a portion
of the distal stomach. The lymph nodes along the lesser
and greater curve of the stomach would add to the total
number of nodes for evaluation but would have little clinical relevance. The SEER database does not distinguish
between these two operations.
Although it is easy to accept a nihilistic attitude toward staging information faced with such an aggressive
biology inherent to adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, it
is important to seek the most accurate staging information against which future therapies can be judged appropriately. One can imagine a trial in which maldistribution of inaccurately staged node-negative patients could
potentially compromise the results, especially given the
large differences in median survival demonstrated from
the LNCP analysis. For example, the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group trial27,28 randomized 49 patients, compared adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy with
observation, and reported an approximate 9-month increase in median survival for patients who received
adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Seventytwo percent of the randomized patients were pathologically staged as node negative. Given the small numbers
in the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group trial, inaccurate staging leading to maldistribution of true nodenegative disease with its associated median survival of
27 months could have a profound and confounding effect
on these reported results. Furthermore, in a recently published meta-analysis of randomized adjuvant therapy trials
for pancreatic cancer, it was noted that roughly 50% of
all patients enrolled in these trials were considered node
negative.29 Without standardization and quality measures to ensure accuracy of staging, we will always question whether maldistribution based on inaccurate staging contributed to the trial result.
In summary, our results demonstrate a significant survival advantage associated with an increasing number of
nodes examined within a large cohort of patients pathologically staged as pN0 after pancreaticoduodenectomy
for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We have attributed this
difference in survival to understaging. Examination of 15
or more lymph nodes appears to be a realistic goal in the
routine staging of pancreas cancer given the average number of nodes examined in large published series of resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Taken together, these
results suggest that the examination of 15 lymph nodes
may serve as a guideline for the accurate staging of pN0
pancreas cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The increased accuracy of staging will undoubtedly allow for
the more precise evaluation of future therapies.

DISCUSSION
Anton Bilchik, MD, Santa Monica, California: Dr Ko and his
colleagues from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]
have presented very provocative data on improving staging accuracy in node-negative pancreas cancer.
Considering the improvements in survival seen in many cancers including colon, breast, and prostate cancer, it is most disappointing that with over 30 000 new cases of pancreas cancer
reported a year in the USA [United States of America], there
are a similar number of deaths. There are several possible
explanations for this: most patients present with advanced
disease because of the paucity of symptoms, early screening
techniques have not been adequately developed nor are they
cost-effective, few patients are candidates for surgical resection, and systemic therapy is limited.
In fact, 2 years ago at the national ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] meeting, a prospective randomized
trial demonstrated that a novel angiogenesis drug was effective for unresectable pancreas cancer. A packed audience applauded, the news hit all the major TV stations. Wall Street was
very happy. The reality, however, was only a 2-week improvement in survival, but the study was large enough to demonstrate a significant P value. This result was far from impressive
to the surgeon sitting in the audience. I think we would all be
criticized heavily if we performed a surgical procedure that improved survival by only 2 weeks.
Dr Ko and colleagues with the assistance of the RAND group
are working closely with the ACS [American College of Surgeons] to provide surgical benchmarks that may ultimately impact reimbursement and referrals to centers of excellence. Not
only is this timely, but we owe it to our patients to apply oncologic principles to every cancer operation we perform. Dr Tomlinson analyzed the SEER database over a 14-year period and
demonstrated that there was a 25% survival benefit in nodenegative pancreas cancer patients if more than 15 LNs [lymph
nodes] were removed. Unfortunately, however, this occurred

in only 19% of patients, with the majority of patients having
fewer than 3 LNs evaluated. I have several questions for the
authors.
1. You mentioned that the population studied reflected the
overall characteristics of the USA. Can you comment on whether
the majority of Whipples performed were in cities with highvolume medical centers, and if so, was there a difference in the
number of lymph nodes retrieved?
2. Your group has previously demonstrated that some of
the characteristics of the primary tumor are prognostic such
as degree of differentiation or margin status. Does this still apply when 15 negative lymph nodes are removed?
3. On the same note, could the number of nodes removed
merely reflect a difference in the amount of small-bowel mesentery resected rather than the number of peripancreatic nodes,
which are more likely to be involved?
4. A recent randomized trial by Yeo et al failed to demonstrate a survival benefit with extended lymphadenectomy in pancreas cancer. This is supported by your study when patients
with more than 25 lymph nodes had a similar survival to patients with less than 5 nodes examined. Would you define 15
lymph nodes as an adequate lymphadenectomy or as an extended lymphadenectomy?
5. You mention that the median number of lymph nodes
reported at 3 major medical centers was at least 15. Do you think
this is a consequence of meticulous surgery or more careful
pathologic evaluation?
6. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of positive LNs
are less than 5 mm in size and it is widely recognized that performing 1 section of an LN (standard practice in the USA) is
likely to miss a metastasis. Do you have designated pancreatic
pathologists at UCLA and does Dr Reber or Dr Hines ask the
pathologist to reexamine the specimen if they receive a pathology report with very few lymph nodes?
7. Finally, do you think stage migration alone explains the
improvement in survival or do you think other factors may be
involved such as the resection of undetected micrometastases
that may be a nidus for recurrence?
I would like to congratulate Dr Tomlinson for an excellent
presentation. These findings will add to a number of recent important studies (in both colon and gastric cancer) where the
resection of lymph nodes was not only important for staging
but impacted survival as well. The application of oncologic principles to all cancer operations and close collaboration with the
pathologist will likely improve the selection of patients for chemotherapy and clinical trials.
Dr Ko: Everyone in the room knows that pay for performance is here and that in the field of surgery, many different
groups are trying to develop quality performance measures. In
surgery, however, the surgeons probably should identify what
are the metrics that will distinguish what is a good surgery from
a not-so-good surgery. In cancer, the National Quality Forum
has addressed breast cancer and colorectal cancer and has endorsed a number of measures in each. And, the payers are following suit by using these measures to evaluate us. So, if we are
going to be evaluated by these measures rather than having somebody else develop them, I think surgeons should figure out what
we think is important and develop quality measures in these areas.
Right now, in terms of pancreatic cancer, the main thing
that is available and is being used regarding quality is the leapfrog measure of hospital volume. However, as I’m sure many
of you will agree, there should probably be something a little
more granular for measuring the quality of pancreas cancer care,
and in that regard, identifying such a measure is what Dr Tomlinson was trying to do.
As with probably all cancers, staging is a foundation for cancer care. It prognosticates, it helps us determine treatments, and

it categorizes patients when we have trials. Most will agree that
having an appropriate sample size of lymph nodes is important.
At this point, I would like to address the issues discussed
by Dr Bilchik. First, he asked if we are able to tell if the procedures were performed at high-volume centers. The database that
we used does not have identifiable information about the centers. So, we don’t know if they were performed in a highvolume or low-volume center. There are clearly other databases that one may use to tell volume, but unfortunately, this
version of SEER does not. I would like to mention that our group
has examined node retrieval rates in colon cancer by high- and
low-volume centers. Much to the surprise of many, there was
little difference in terms of achieving the appropriate number
of nodes—regardless of volume.
Dr Bikchik then asked about the importance of degree of
differentiation and margin status. When we looked at predictors of outcome, once you take node status out of the equation, differentiation is significant. Notwithstanding the difficulty of consistently defining well vs moderate vs poor
differentiation across the board, when we dichotomized grade
into 2 groups, there was a statistical association with survival.
So, it is important but not as important as the nodes. Unfortunately, no large registry has margin status that I know of—so
we were not able to study that variable.
The next question was whether the number of nodes reflect the amount of tissue taken with the small-bowel mesentery or whether a pylorus sparing or a standard Whipple would
affect the node number. Although there is probably not very
much, if any, small-bowel mesentery taken during a standard
resection, there is likely a difference in node number for a pylorus sparing vs a standard Whipple. But again, as I was trying
to say earlier, we are at a point where we are still trying to get
to the “floor” of quality. We are still trying to get to 12 in colon. Once we get to 12 consistently, we can start identifying
where these nodes are and whether there is micrometastasis
or things like that beyond that. I think the same thing holds
for pancreatic cancer. Let’s start by achieving 15, and then we
can address the subsequent issues next.
The next question was whether 15 nodes could be achieved
in a standard lymphadenectomy or would an extended operation be required. As was discussed, what Dr Tomlinson showed,
the numbers at Memorial and the numbers at Hopkins meet
the criteria and they are not performing extended Whipples.

The next question addressed the issue of whether surgery
or pathology is the key. It’s probably both. Like other cancers,
the surgeons have to take out the nodes and the pathologist
has to find them—it’s a 2-part thing.
The next question was, do you have a designated pancreatic pathologist at UCLA? Yes, we have such a pathologist. There
is a weekly conference that Dr Hines and Dr Reber run where
they review the cases and the pathology in a multidisciplinary
conference. This is helpful for a number of reasons, but for this
issue, there is constant feedback being provided.
Finally, Dr Bilchik’s last question was, do you think this is
stage migration or could it be that we are resecting micrometastases? It could be both, but I’m not certain. For now, I definitely think stage migration is playing a role. Resection of micrometastasis could also be important, but I think it probably
requires further study to know.
David R. Byrd, MD, Seattle, Washington: My comment is
to expand on those by Drs Bilchik and Ko about the importance of the collaboration with the pathologist. I would submit that the highest yield we could have on this whole issue,
not just with nodal evaluation in patients with pancreatic cancer but with colon, breast, melanoma sentinel nodes, and others, is to formally sit down with the pathologist and our specimens. Using the diagrams similar to those that you saw in this
presentation, we can show the pathologist where the nodes are
that we think we have removed, what we are looking for, and
have a dialogue in person. If everybody in this room did this
for these diseases and reported back next year what the change
was in the number of nodes that were found, I think that we
would see how big an issue it is. If we remain proactive, we
will keep our credibility with our medical oncology colleagues about our ability both to find nodes and to perform an
adequate and accurate node dissection. I think it starts with our
face-to-face dialogue with the pathologist.
James E. Goodnight Jr, MD, PhD, Sacramento, California: Well said, Dr Byrd. Obviously this concept was pioneered
by Dr Wong and it has carried forward about adequate staging, but as I listened to this paper, nicely done, I can’t help but
recall the movie The Deer Hunter. You have spun the barrel 14
times and it came up negative each time. Do you want to spin
it the 15th time? My goodness, it’s pretty dramatic.
