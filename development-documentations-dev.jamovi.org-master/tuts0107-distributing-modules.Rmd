title: "Distributing Modules"
---

Calls to `jmvtools::install()` produce a file with the extension `.jmo` in the current working directory. This file *is* your module, and can be distributed to other people, to 'side-load'. This is a good way to distribute your module during testing, where you might want to send it to a handful of people. People can side-load modules from within the jamovi store (accessible from a menu at the top right of jamovi).

Once you are satisfied that your module is ready for broader distribution, we encourage you to submit it to the jamovi store. This makes your module browseable and discoverable by anyone using jamovi.

If you have a module you would like to submit to the jamovi store, do get in touch with us: [contact@jamovi.org](mailto:contact@jamovi.org)
