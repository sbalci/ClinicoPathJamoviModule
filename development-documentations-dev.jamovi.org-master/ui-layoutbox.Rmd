**Inherits from [`BaseControl`](ui-basecontrol.html), [`ParentControl`](ui-parentcontrol.html)**

A `LayoutBox` allows a designer to control the layout of its child controls. A `LayoutBox` does not display anything itself but purely serves as a frame for placing other controls. It can be used as a list (default), inline list, or grid.

##Properties

In addition to any inherited properties, a `LayoutBox` supports:

Property      | Description                               | Form                 |
------------- | ------------------------------------------| -------------------- |
`style`  | Determines how the automatic layout behavior of the control. | *enum*: list, inline

###Further Details

####`style`

-	`list`: Children will be added in a vertical manner starting at `cell` position `column: 0, row: 0`.
-	`inline`: Children will be added in a horizontal manner starting at `cell` position `column: 0, row: 0`.

To add to a `LayoutBox` in a grid format, use the `cell` property of the child control. As the `LayoutBox` is positioning its `children` it will use the `cell` property of the control to place it correctly. The `cell` property of a child control overrides the auto positioning of the `style` property. If a child control does not have a `cell` property defined it will use the `style` property to automatically place it based on the position of the previous child.
