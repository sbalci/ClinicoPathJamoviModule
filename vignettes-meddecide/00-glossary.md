# MedDecide Glossary (Clinician-Friendly)

- Sensitivity: Among patients with disease, the percent correctly identified as positive.
- Specificity: Among patients without disease, the percent correctly identified as negative.
- Positive Predictive Value (PPV): Chance a positive result truly has disease; depends on prevalence.
- Negative Predictive Value (NPV): Chance a negative result truly does not have disease; depends on prevalence.
- Likelihood Ratio (LR+ / LR−): How much a test result shifts disease odds. LR+ >10 or LR− <0.1 are strong shifts.
- Pre-test Probability: Your estimated chance of disease before testing (from prevalence, risk factors, or clinician judgment).
- Post-test Probability: Updated chance of disease after seeing a test result (via Bayes’ theorem).
- ROC Curve / AUC: Curve of sensitivity vs 1−specificity across thresholds; AUC ~ overall discrimination (0.5 no better than chance; 1.0 perfect).
- Decision Curve Analysis (Net Benefit): Weighs true positives against false positives at a chosen threshold probability to show clinical utility.
- Threshold Probability: The risk level at which you would treat (e.g., treat if risk ≥20%).
- Kappa: Agreement beyond chance between raters/tests; ~0.6 “moderate”, ~0.8 “good”.
- Markov Model: State-based model (e.g., healthy → sick → death) used to project long-term outcomes and costs.
- QALY: Quality-adjusted life year; combines survival and quality of life.
- ICER: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio = ΔCost / ΔQALY (cost per additional QALY).
