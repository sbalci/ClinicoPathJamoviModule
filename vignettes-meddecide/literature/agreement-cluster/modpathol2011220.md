Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) applies specific diagnostic criteria to designate a monoclonal
endometrial preinvasive glandular proliferation known from previous studies to confer a 45-fold increased risk
for endometrial cancer. In this international study we estimate accuracy and precision of EIN diagnosis among
20 reviewing pathologists in different practice environments, and with differing levels of experience and
training. Sixty-two endometrial biopsies diagnosed as benign, EIN, or adenocarcinoma by consensus of two
expert subspecialty pathologists were used as a reference comparison to assess diagnostic accuracy of 20
reviewing pathologists. Interobserver reproducibility among the 20 reviewers provided a measure of diagnostic
precision. Before evaluating cases, observers were self-trained by reviewing published textbook and/or online
EIN diagnostic guidelines. Demographics of the reviewing pathologists, and their impressions regarding
implementation of EIN terminology were recorded. Seventy-nine percent of the 20 reviewing pathologistsÆ
diagnoses were exactly concordant with the expert consensus (accuracy). The interobserver weighted j values
of 3-class EIN scheme (benign, EIN, carcinoma) diagnoses between expert consensus and each of reviewing
pathologists averaged 0.72 (reproducibility, or precision). Reviewing pathologists demonstrated one of three
diagnostic styles, which varied in the repertoire of diagnoses commonly used, and their nonrandom response
to potentially confounding diagnostic features such as endometrial polyp, altered differentiation, background
hormonal effects, and technically poor preparations. EIN diagnostic strategies can be learned and implemented
from standard teaching materials with a high degree of reproducibility, but is impacted by the personal
diagnostic style of each pathologist in responding to potential diagnostic confounders.

Reproducibility of EIN Diagnosis

endometrial
Correct diagnosis of precancerous
lesions enables treatment before progression to an
invasive neoplasm. Correspondingly, exclusion of
a premalignant lesion is important to avoid over
treatment. Precancerous
in the current
WHO schema are encompassed within a spectrum
of four types of endometrial hyperplasias, diagnosis
of which has a high intra- and interobserver varia-
bility1û5 in addition to modest predictive value for
carcinoma.1,2,6 New diagnostic criteria,
for fewer
diagnostic categories, are required to resolve these
issues.

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) is a
high-cancer-risk lesion first proposed by an interna-
tional group of pathologists in 2000,7 in response
to newly emergent molecular, histomorphometric,
and clinical outcome studies.7û9 EIN fulfills all lines
of evidence necessary to define a premalignant
lesion, as established by a National Cancer Insti-
tute-sponsored consensus conference in 2006.10
Molecular studies have shown that these lesions
are clonally related to invasive carcinomas.11û13
Correlation of molecular, histomorphometric, and
clonal characteristics of endometrial lesions with
clinical cancer outcomes has permitted de novo
criteria, which
discovery of
characterize premalignant
thus enabling
precise definition of EIN diagnostic criteria.14,15
Key changes include objective architectural thresh-
olds (gland area exceeds that of stroma), interpreta-
tion of cytological changes relative to background
normal glands in the same sample, and minimum
lesion size (1 mm) within a single tissue fragment.
EIN classification has better diagnostic reproduci-
bility16 and cancer predictive value than17 WHO
endometrial hyperplasias. Patients with EIN lesions
have a 45-fold increased endometrial cancer risk.13
EIN has simple diagnostic criteria, outlined above,
that can be used on a routine basis using only
standard hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue with-
out the need for additional immunohistochemical or
sophisticated molecular studies.8 This characteristic
makes it very appealing to the routine pathologist.
Successful implementation of any new diagnostic
schema, however, requires learning new criteria and
consistently applying them in the intended manner.
This is especially challenging with EIN, as the
background tissue appearance is highly variable,
and some lesion features such as size, method of
assessing cytological change, and threshold gland
densities are unfamiliar to many pathologists. Prior
studies testing the reproducibility of this termino-
logy have involved teams consisting only of
gynecological pathologists, moreover some of these
were carried out using the morphometric D-score
rather than plain light microscopy.9,18,19 In this study
we test the reproducibility of the EIN diagnosis
using only light microscopy. We further tried to
emphasize its simplicity, with respect to the ease of
learning and application of the diagnostic criteria,
even to the inexperienced routine pathologist.

endometrial

Sixty-two
curettage
materials performed for suspicion of endometrial
hyperplasia between the years of 2001 and 2008,
were retrieved from the archives of the Pathology
Department of the Hacettepe University. We com-
piled a case mix of roughly equal numbers of
atypical (n ╝ 25), complex non-atypical endometrial
hyperplasia
and simple non-atypical
(n ╝ 4)supplemented with examples diagnosed pre-
viously as diagnostically difficult benign lesions
suspected by the pathologist to represent some form
of hyperplasia (n ╝ 8) or carcinoma (n ╝ 4). One
representative slide from each of the 62 technically
adequate endometrial biopsies was assessed by the
reviewing study pathologists.

(n ╝ 21)

EIN Diagnostic Categories

Each case was classified into one of the following
diagnostic entities: specimen technically inadequate
for diagnosis, benign non-EIN, EIN, or adenocarci-
noma. EIN was diagnosed according to published
criteria that include presence of all five diagnostic
elements as listed here:15

(1) Gland area greater than stromal area
(2) Cytological demarcation of the lesion relative to

background

(3) Lesion size exceeds 1 mm in minimum diameter
(4) Exclusion of mimics
(5) Exclusion of cancer

Reference EIN Diagnoses by Expert Panel
(æExpert PathologistsÆ)

All 62 cases were rediagnosed using published EIN
criteria by two subspecialty trained gynecological
pathologists involved in the initial development
of EIN diagnostic criteria (expert 1 and expert 2).
Each expert
independently reviewed all cases
blinded to history and prior diagnoses, and a con-
sensus expert diagnosis (æreferenceÆ) was attained
by blinded agreement, or in cases of disagreement,
by adjudication at a multiheaded microscope.

Review by Practicing Pathologists (æReviewing
PathologistsÆ)

Following review of published training materials,
20 practicing pathologists rediagnosed all cases
blinded to the reference EIN diagnosis and all
clinical features. These 20 European pathologists
differed in the duration of practice experience and
practice context. Seventeen were gynecological
pathologists working in different regions of Turkey
either in university or community hospitals with

varying gynecological material workloads. Three
were general surgical pathologists without specia-
lized training in gynecopathology. Before evaluating
the cases all participants were advised to read two
references ; æBenign Endometrial Hyperplasia and
in RobboyÆs Pathology of Female
EIN æchapter
Reproductive Tract20 and view online instructional
material at www.endometrium.org. After scoring the
slides, each pathologist completed a questionnaire
grading (on a 5-point scale) the learnability and
usefulness of the EIN terminology in daily practice
(Table 1).

Statistical Analysis

A measure of diagnostic accuracy for each reviewing
pathologist was generated by comparison with
reference diagnoses. Reference diagnoses were the
adjudicated concensus diagnoses of experts 1 and 2.
Accuracy was expressed in two metrics:
that
percentage of cases in which the reference and
reviewing pathologist diagnoses were concordant;
and the weighted kappa statistic (kw) between the
reviewing pathologist and reference diagnoses.
Interobserver agreement between the 20 reviewing
pathologists, a measure of diagnostic reproducibi-
lity, was calculated using the kappa statistic (k)
for multiple raters when there are more than two
diagnostic outcomes.21

To evaluate the effect of current

institutional
affiliation, type of practice (speciality gynecological

pathologist vs general surgical pathologist) and the
diagnostic system currently used (EIN vs WHO) on
the % agreement between reviewer and reference;
we used MannûWhitney U and KruskalûWallis tests.
We explored the effect of the continuous variable of
years of pathology experience on the % agreement
using the Spearman correlation analysis. Kappa
analyses and the statistical tests were performed in
STATA version 10.0. The statistical significance was
set at Po0.05.

Diagnostic trends were examined by hierarchical
cluster analysis in a heat-map (color ╝ diagnosis)
matrix of reviewer (columns) by case (X and Y axis,
respectively). On the basis of
the hierarchical
clustering of 20 reviewers, each was assigned to a
diagnostic style group. Cluster analysis using a
metric of percentage agreement and WardÆs linkage
was performed in Systat (v13, 2009, Systat Software,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Specimen Adequacy

All 62 specimens were considered technically
adequate by the expert reviewers, who assigned
diagnoses to each. Among the 20 reviewers review-
ing the 62 cases, there were 1240 ædiagnostic passesÆ.
Of these, 99% (1229/1240) were considered diag-
nosable by the reviewers, who rendered a specific
diagnosis.

Reproducibility of EIN Diagnosis

A Usubutun et al

Expert Review and Reference Consensus Diagnoses

The two expert reviewers agreed on the diagnostic
classification as EIN vs other (benign non-EIN, or
adenocarcinoma) and the consensus expert refer-
ence diagnoses, included 27 benign non-EIN, 26
EIN, and 9 adenocarcinoma cases.

Agreement Between Expert Reference and Each of
20 Observers

The percent agreement with regard to the reference
diagnoses for the 20 individual pathologists are
shown in Table 2. Overall, 79% of all reviewer
diagnoses were exactly concordant with the refer-
ence expert diagnoses. As expected, unanimous
agreement among all 20 reviewers was uncommon,
occurring in 18 cases, (17 benign, 1 adenocarcino-
ma). The weighted k values of each observer with
the final consensus diagnosis are shown in Table 2,
averaged 0.72, and varied between 0.45 and 0.84.

Interobserver Reproducibility Among 20 Independent
Observers

The extent of
interobserver diagnostic concor-
dance between all pairwise permutations of each

of the 20 reviewers was calculated as a 20 (cid:2) 20
Spearman correlation matrix of 62 cases across all
reviewers. Of all 190 possible pairwise interobserver
comparisons of reviewer classification, the average
Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.72, range
0.37û0.93. The overall k (Interobserver reproduci-
bility) among 20 independent observers was calcu-
lated as 0.58 for all diagnostic groups (benign vs EIN
vs cancer), 0.64 for benign (vs EIN ■ CA), 0.47 for
EIN (vs benign ■ cancer), and 0.64 for carcinoma
(vs benign ■ EIN).

Characteristics of 20 Independent Reviewers

In
response to the questionnaire (Table 1) only one
observer read none of the recommended text, the
other observers read at least one (two observers) or

On a 5-grade scale (1 defines ædisagreeÆ, while
5 defines æabsolutely agreeÆ) observers think that
the EIN terminology is learnable (mean 4.16) and
moderately easy to use in daily practice (mean 3.76).

The extent of concordance between reviewer
and expert reference diagnoses (Table 2) was not
significantly different by reviewer years of experi-
ence (r ╝ 0.149, P ╝ 0.529), practice type (P ╝ 0.926),
training institution (P ╝ 0.082), practice institution
at the time of study (P ╝ 0.255), or classification
system used in practice (P ╝ 0.437).

Diagnostic Style Groups

Figure 1 shows patterns of pathologist diagnosis
based on percentage of matching interobserver
diagnoses. Discordant cases (Figure 1, rows, marked
by arrows), which polarized the reviewing patho-
logists (Columns) into different diagnostic clusters
(diagnostic æstyle groupsÆ) groups were identified
(Figure 1, arrows).

Figure 1 is a detailed hierarchical dendrogram
organizing each pathologist into one of three distinct
diagnostic style groups designated here by the color
of the branch termini (green, yellow, red). When the
expert reference diagnoses are reintroduced in the
same analysis by comparison, the reference diag-
noses cosegregate with the red style. Diagnostic style
group membership was not significantly associated
with reviewer years of experience (P ╝ 0.435),
practice type (exact P ╝ 0.228), training institution
(exact P ╝ 0.236), practice institution at the time of
study (exact P ╝ 0.204), or classification system used
in practice (exact P ╝ 0.376).

Unblinded secondary review was undertaken
by one expert pathologist (expert 1) and the study
head (reviewer E) for subsets of cases (Figure 1,
arrows), which most distinguished the minority
red and green diagnostic style groups (Figure 1).
This included five cases preferentially diagnosed as
EIN by the red group but benign by the others
(Figure 1, arrows on the right), and five cases
preferentially diagnosed as benign non-EIN by the
green group, but as EIN by the others (Figure 1,
arrows on the left). Unblinded observations from
the secondary review of these cases are shown in
Table 3.

Discussion

This study shows good interobserver diagnostic
reproducibility by a mixed group of pathologists
applying published criteria for diagnosis of endo-
metrial biopsies (cases with a previous diagnosis of
hyperplasia) according to the EIN schema (benign,
EIN, cancer). Benign, premalignant
(EIN), and
malignant (cancer) diagnoses represent an ascend-
ing severity of disease that initiate differing clinical
interventions, underscoring the need to discrimi-
nate all three entities. A full-spectrum case mix
permitted assessment of diagnostic reproducibility
across two different decision thresholds of benign vs
neoplastic (EIN or cancer) and non-malignant

balanced reproducibility between EIN and the range
of lesser and worse entities with which it is likely to
be confused.

Previous studies testing the reproducibility of the
WHO hyperplasia classification have revealed poor
to good interobserver agreement for the high-risk
group (Table 4).1,2,5,22,23 A peculiar feature is that,
although the 1994 WHO hyperplasia classification
contains four discrete hyperplasia entities (simple/
complex, combined with atypical/non-atypical),
few of these studies record and analyze four cate-
gories exactly as defined by the WHO. Atypical

occurrence that some groups doubt whether it truly
exists5 (Skov), whereas others beg the question by
combining it with complex atypical hyperplasias
during analysis. The result is that few of the studies
use the 4-class WHO scheme as published and most
published results represent contractions thereof.
In its most extreme form, aggregation of complex
and simple atypical hyperplasias with well differ-
entiated carcinoma under the rubric of æendometrial
neoplasiaÆ has been proposed.1 In general, these
aggregation strategies do improve interobserver
reproducibility, there being fewer choices to con-
sider. Thus the low overall interobserver reproduci-
bility for the full 4-class WHO scheme (k 0.2û0.25),5
improves substantially upon combining simple and
complex atypical hyperplasias into a single group
(k 0.40û0.69).1,2,22 In these cases, what is actually

being reported upon is something different than the
published WHO 4-class system. A further factor is
that the overall reproducibility likelihood is affected
by the range of non-hyperplastic tissues included in
the series, especially whether carcinomas and
normal tissues are included or excluded during case
selection.

The EIN lesion is a singular entity representing
a high-risk premalignant
lesion, which from its
inception has been documented by a published
body of molecular, histopathological, and clinical
outcome evidence. Similar to the aggregated WHO
hyperplasia categories, it has the reproducibility
advantage of fewer entities, but differs in achieving
this by design and precise primary definition
rather than secondary bundling of categories during
analysis. Most pathologists now recognize that

clinico-biological
groups.1,2,7,22 The evidence base for EIN includes
new clinical outcome predictive diagnostic features
such as lesion size, quantitative gland density,
and methods of interpreting cytology that provide
pathologists with improved diagnostic criteria
relative to those within the 1994-vintage WHO
scheme.
Implementation of a tripartite (benign-
EIN-cancer) scheme is most responsibly accom-
plished by using expanded and explicit criteria
such as those published for EIN.

We carried forward the diagnostic patterns of each
pathologist through complete data analysis, allow-
ing us to discern how individual cases divided
pathologists into diagnostic clusters or æstylesÆ. This
is shown intuitively as a graphic matrix of cases
by pathologists organized into clusters based on
diagnostic proximity (Figure 1). Pathologists fell
into three different style groups, which can simply
be described as follows: (1) a majority group of
11 pathologists who used a balanced spectrum of
benign, EIN, and carcinoma diagnoses (Figure 1,
Yellow); (2) four pathologists who favored benign
diagnoses and infrequently diagnosed EIN or carci-
noma (Figure 1, green); and (3) five pathologists
who favored EIN diagnosis more than their peers
(Figure 1, red). Pathologists are well aware of this
phenomenon of diagnostic style, using terms such as
æsplitters vs lumpers,Æ or æbenign vs malignantÆ to
classify the diagnostic personality of colleagues.
These data demonstrate its expression in practice
and suggest that diagnostic behavior of the indivi-
dual pathologist is subject to limited modification
by simple elaboration of diagnostic criteria or
retraining. There are many possible personal experi-
ences that might contribute to individual diagnostic
style, but in this limited study we were unable to
show a correlation with place of training, practice
environment, years of practice, or practice type.

Detailed examination of those individual cases
capable of polarizing pathologists into style groups
provides clues to the basis of predictable, nonran-
dom diagnostic disagreement. The red style group
had a tendency to diagnose reference EIN lesions not
appreciated by the other groups, including those
with confounding factors of altered differentiation
(case 51), small size of localized EIN focus (case 6),
or background stromal breakdown (case 25). Corres-
pondingly, the red style group overdiagnosed as
EIN some reference benign cases, which were
technically inferior preparations (case 44, 61) or
had confusing global estrogen-induced changes
(case 61). The green style group tended to diagnose
EIN reference cases as benign when tubal differen-
tiation was geographically present in the EIN (cases
11, 14, 26, 38), when the EIN was focally distributed
within only one of many fragments (case 26) or was
present within a polyp (case 16).

The cases with discordant results were usually due
to reasons previously described in the literature.8,16

Reproducibility of EIN Diagnosis

EIN lesions may arise completely or partially within
endometrial polyps and the diagnosis of EIN within
a polyp can be problematic24 because polyps
themselves have variable gland density and some-
what altered gland cytology.8,16 It has been stressed
before that when making a diagnosis of EIN within a
polyp the suspicious focus should be compared
with the polyp background and not that of the
uninvolved endometrium, so as not to mistake the
somewhat altered gland cytology that can be seen
within polyps for EIN.25 The minimum size for a
lesion to be considered as EIN was determined to be
1 mm in maximum dimension within a single tissue
fragment.18,26,27 Small foci can be overlooked, also
accounting for discordance in our study. Technical
artifacts, due to poor fixation and processing, in
some cases made it difficult to evaluate both large
scale (architecture) and small scale (cytology) fea-
tures of EIN lesions. This is a problem not specific
to the endometrium. Lastly, the altered cytology that
characterizes EIN must be interpreted within the
context of both cytoplasmic and nuclear findings.
Several cases with prominent cytoplasmic changes
were construed as benign metaplasias rather than
EIN. The clue to an EIN diagnosis in these examples
is the clustered and discrete nature of the altered
gland focus, in contrast to randomly distributed
hormonally induced metaplasias, or reactive cyto-
logical change in association with stromal break-
down.25

An important finding of our study is that EIN
morphological criteria can be easily learnt and
that learning ability is not affected by years of
experience. One of the reviewers in the study, who
was not a gynecological pathologist and was un-
familiar with the terminology and diagnostic criter-
ia, had a good (k 0.72) diagnostic agreement with the
reference diagnoses. Furthermore, survey results
showed that
the EIN morphological criteria are
easy to learn (graded as 4.16, with 5.0 being æagree
completelyÆ). These results underscore that self-
learning of morphological criteria of EIN is possible
and easy. However, reviewing pathologists thought
that application of this knowledge to practice is not
as easy as learning the criteria. Observers graded
ease of application of the diagnostic criteria to daily
practice as 3.76 on a 5-grade scale. The pathologists
who were using the EIN terminology and diagnostic
criteria on their daily practice had similar results
and good agreement with the consensus diagnosis
(0.69û0.78). We must remember that all of the WHO
studies mentioned above use criteria, which every
pathologist is familiar with. We may assume that the
diagnostic reproducibility of the pathologists will
increase as EIN criteria are used in daily practice, as
results of our study suggest.

In summary the reproducibility of the EIN diag-
noses was high in our study, especially considering
the fact that the group consisted of a variety of
pathologists. Our group included a mix of speciality
gynecological and general pathologists, and we
