# Unlock Advanced Clinicopathological Analysis with ClinicoPath for Jamovi

## Abstract

**Problem:** Clinicians and researchers often struggle with the steep learning curve of programming languages like R when performing complex statistical analyses for medical research.

**Solution:** **ClinicoPathJamoviModule** bridges this gap by bringing powerful R-based clinicopathological tools into the user-friendly, point-and-click interface of jamovi.

In this post, you'll learn:
- How to perform advanced survival analysis without writing code.
- Ways to generate publication-ready "Table 1" and diagnostic accuracy plots.
- How to streamline your research workflow using this open-source tool.

## 1. The Challenge: Advanced Stats without the Code

Medical research demands rigorous statistics—survival analysis, inter-rater agreement, diagnostic accuracy. traditionally, you had two choices: pay expensive license fees for software like SPSS/SAS, or spend months learning R programming.

**ClinicoPath** changes the game. It is a comprehensive module for **jamovi**, a free and open-source statistical platform. It wraps complex R packages into an intuitive GUI, allowing you to focus on the *medicine* rather than the *syntax*.

### Key Capabilities
*   **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier, Cox Regression, Competing Risks.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Automated "Table 1", Age Pyramids, Alluvial Plots.
*   **Diagnostic Accuracy**: ROC Curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA).
*   **Agreement**: Kappa, Bland-Altman, Inter-rater reliability.

## 2. Getting Started

### Installation

You can use ClinicoPath directly within jamovi or as a standalone R package.

#### Option A: Inside jamovi (Recommended for non-coders)
1.  Open [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org).
2.  Click the **+ Modules** icon at the top right.
3.  Select **jamovi library**.
4.  Search for **ClinicoPath** and click **Install**.

#### Option B: In R (For data scientists)
If you prefer the flexibility of R, you can install the development version directly from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")

# Install ClinicoPath from GitHub
devtools::install_github("sbalci/ClinicoPathJamoviModule")
```

## 3. Practical Workflow: From Data to Publication

Let's walk through a typical research scenario: analyzing a dataset of cancer patients to evaluate a new biomarker.

### Step 1: Descriptive Statistics (Table 1)

Every medical paper needs a "Table 1" describing the baseline characteristics.

**In jamovi:**
1.  Go to the **ClinicoPath** tab.
2.  Select **Descriptive Statistics** > **Table One**.
3.  Drag your variables (e.g., Age, Gender, Stage) into the "Rows" box.
4.  Drag your grouping variable (e.g., Treatment Arm) into the "Columns" box.

**Result:** A formatted table with counts, percentages, and automatically calculated p-values (Chi-square/Fisher's for categorical, t-test/Mann-Whitney for continuous).

### Step 2: Survival Analysis

To see if the biomarker affects patient survival:

**In jamovi:**
1.  Select **Survival** > **Survival Analysis**.
2.  Set `Time` as your time variable and `Status` as your event variable (e.g., 1=Dead, 0=Censored).
3.  Add your biomarker to **Explanatory Variables**.

**Key Output:**
*   **Kaplan-Meier Curves**: With risk tables and censorship markers.
*   **Cox Regression**: Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals.
*   **Assumptions Check**: Tests for proportional hazards assumption.

### Step 3: Diagnostic Accuracy

Is the biomarker a good diagnostic tool?

**In jamovi:**
1.  Select **Medical Decision** > **ROC Analysis**.
2.  Enter the biomarker level and the gold-standard outcome.
3.  Tick **Decision Curve Analysis** to see the net benefit across threshold probabilities.

## 4. Advanced Feature: R Integration

One of the strongest features of jamovi + ClinicoPath is that it writes the R code *for you*. This is perfect for learning R or ensuring reproducibility.

**Syntax Mode:**
1.  In jamovi, click the three dots (top right) > **Syntax mode**.
2.  Perform your analysis using the GUI.
3.  Copy the generated R code!

**Example Code generated by the module:**

```r
# Example of how you might run a survival analysis programmatically
# using the underlying functions (conceptual):

library(ClinicoPath)
library(survival)

# Fit a simple survival object
surv_obj <- Surv(time = lung$time, event = lung$status)

# Run Kaplan-Meier analysis
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ sex, data = lung)

# Visualize (ClinicoPath wraps complex plotting libraries like survminer)
ggsurvplot(km_fit, data = lung, pval = TRUE)
```

## 5. Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | ClinicoPath (jamovi) | SPSS/SAS | Pure R |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Cost** | Free (Open Source) | $$$ High | Free |
| **Interface** | Modern GUI | Dated GUI | CLI / Code |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Reproducibility** | High (R Syntax mode) | Low (Menu clicks) | High |
| **Advanced Plots** | Yes (ggplot2 based) | Limited | Unlimited |

## 6. Troubleshooting

**Issue 1: Module fails to install in jamovi**
*   **Cause:** Often due to older jamovi versions or R package dependencies.
*   **Solution:** Update jamovi to the latest version (>= 2.3). If sideloading, ensure you have the correct `.jmo` file for your OS.

**Issue 2: "Dependency not available" error in R**
*   **Cause:** ClinicoPath depends on many packages (e.g., `survminer`, `gtsummary`).
*   **Solution:** Install dependencies manually:
    ```r
    install.packages(c("survival", "survminer", "gtsummary", "pROC"))
    devtools::install_github("sbalci/ClinicoPathJamoviModule")
    ```

## Conclusion

**ClinicoPathJamoviModule** democratizes access to high-end statistical tools. It allows clinicians to perform their own sophisticated analyses—from **competing risks** to **decision curves**—without needing a degree in biostatistics or computer science.

**Next Steps:**
*   Download [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org).
*   Install the **ClinicoPath** module.
*   Try the "Table One" feature on your own dataset.
