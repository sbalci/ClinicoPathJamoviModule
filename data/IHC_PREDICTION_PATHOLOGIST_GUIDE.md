## Overview

This two-phase workflow allows you to:
1. **Train** a diagnostic model using cases with known (molecularly confirmed) diagnoses
2. **Predict** diagnoses for new cases with unknown diagnoses based on their IHC patterns

**Key Principle:** The training and prediction datasets must be kept completely separate.

---

## Before You Begin

### Required Materials

✅ **Training dataset:**
- 30-100 cases with **molecularly confirmed** diagnoses
- Same IHC panel performed on all cases
- Standardized scoring method (e.g., binary pos/neg, H-score, % positivity)
- Case IDs for tracking

✅ **Query dataset:**
- New cases awaiting diagnosis
- Same IHC markers as training dataset
- Same scoring method
- Case IDs for tracking

✅ **Software:**
- jamovi statistical software (free download from jamovi.org)
- ClinicoPath module installed

### Important Concepts

**Training Set** = Cases with known diagnoses (your reference library)
**Query Set** = Cases with unknown diagnoses (what you want to predict)
**Markers** = IHC antibodies (must be identical in both datasets)
**Confidence Score** = Algorithm's certainty about prediction (0-1 scale)

---

## Phase 1: Training Dataset Preparation

### Step 1.1: Gather Training Cases

Select cases that meet **all** of these criteria:

✅ Molecularly confirmed diagnosis (e.g., RT-PCR, FISH, NGS)
✅ Adequate tissue for IHC panel
✅ IHC panel completed with interpretable results
✅ Representative of the diagnostic differential you want to address

**Minimum requirements:**
- **At least 10 cases per diagnosis category**
- **Recommended: 20-30 cases per diagnosis**
- **Ideal: 50+ cases per diagnosis**

**Example Diagnostic Differential:**
```
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Panel:
- Synovial Sarcoma (n=25 with SYT-SSX fusion confirmed)
- MPNST (n=23 with S100 and NF1 loss confirmed)
- Ewing Sarcoma (n=27 with EWSR1 rearrangement confirmed)
```

### Step 1.2: Create Training Data Spreadsheet

Open Excel/Google Sheets and create a table with this structure:

**Required columns:**
- `CaseID`: Unique identifier for each case
- `Diagnosis`: Confirmed diagnosis (must be exact text, no typos)
- One column per IHC marker with standardized values

**Column Naming Rules:**
- No spaces in marker names (use underscores: `CK7` not `CK 7`)
- Consistent spelling (don't mix `ER` and `ERalpha`)
- Use descriptive names if needed (`Ki67_Percent`, `AR_Hscore`)

**Example Table Structure:**

```csv
CaseID,Diagnosis,EMA,CK7,bcl2,CD56,S100,Nestin,NGFR,CD99,Fli1,Ki67_Percent,AR_Hscore
SS001,Synovial_Sarcoma,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Negative,15.5,200
SS002,Synovial_Sarcoma,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,22.3,180
MPNST001,MPNST,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,8.2,0
MPNST002,MPNST,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,12.1,50
EWS001,Ewing_Sarcoma,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,35.8,0
EWS002,Ewing_Sarcoma,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,42.1,0
```

### Step 1.3: Standardize IHC Scoring

**For categorical markers (Positive/Negative):**
- Use consistent terminology: `Positive` or `Negative` (not `pos`/`neg`, `+`/`-`)
- Define your cutoff (e.g., >10% nuclear staining = Positive)
- Apply same cutoff to ALL cases

**For ordinal markers (0/1+/2+/3+):**
- Use consistent notation: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` (not `1+`, `++`)
- Document interpretation (e.g., 2+ = moderate intensity)

**For continuous markers (H-score, % positivity):**
- H-score: Range 0-300 (% positive × intensity)
- Percentage: Range 0-100
- Use decimals for precision (15.5 not 15 or 16)

### Step 1.4: Data Quality Checks

Before proceeding, verify:

✅ No missing values in critical markers (or mark as `NA` if unavoidable)
✅ Diagnosis spelling is **identical** for all cases of same type
✅ All marker values use consistent format
✅ Case IDs are unique (no duplicates)
✅ All molecularly confirmed cases have molecular test results documented

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- ❌ Mixing "Synovial Sarcoma" and "Synovial_Sarcoma" → Pick one format
- ❌ Using "pos"/"neg" in some cases and "Positive"/"Negative" in others
- ❌ Including training cases without molecular confirmation
- ❌ Leaving blank cells instead of writing "Negative" or `NA`

### Step 1.5: Save Training Dataset

1. Save as **CSV (Comma Separated Values)** file
2. Choose a descriptive name: `sarcoma_training_2025.csv`
3. Remember the file path (you'll need it later)
4. **Keep a backup copy**

---

## Phase 2: Running ihccluster Analysis

### Step 2.1: Load Training Data into jamovi

1. Open jamovi
2. Click **Open** → Navigate to your training CSV file
3. Click **Data** tab → Verify all columns imported correctly
4. Check that diagnosis column is imported as **Nominal** (categorical)
5. Check that categorical markers are **Nominal**
6. Check that continuous markers are **Continuous**

**If data types are wrong:**
- Click on column header
- Change **Data Type** dropdown
- Click **Measure Type** dropdown to change Nominal/Ordinal/Continuous

### Step 2.2: Run ihccluster Analysis

1. Click **Analyses** tab
2. Navigate to: **OncoPath** → **IHC Analysis** → **IHC Clustering Analysis**

### Step 2.3: Select Variables

**Basic Settings:**

**Categorical IHC Markers:**
- Select all binary markers (Positive/Negative)
- Examples: EMA, CK7, bcl2, CD56, S100, Nestin, NGFR, CD99, Fli1

**Continuous IHC Markers:**
- Select all quantitative markers
- Examples: Ki67_Percent, AR_Hscore

**Case ID:** (Optional but recommended)
- Select your case identifier column
- Helps with tracking specific cases

### Step 2.4: Enable Diagnostic Features

**Critical Settings - Must Enable These:**

✅ **Known Diagnosis (optional):** Select your `Diagnosis` column

✅ **Calculate Marker Performance Metrics:** Check this box
- This calculates sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV for each marker

✅ **Identify Optimal Antibody Panels:** Check this box
- Panel Size: Select `Both 2 and 3-marker panels`
- This finds best marker combinations

✅ **Flag Atypical Cases:** Check this box (should be default)
- Outlier Threshold: Leave at 0.25
- Flags cases requiring molecular confirmation

### Step 2.5: Review Clustering Results

Once analysis completes, review these key outputs:

**1. Analysis Summary:**
- Optimal number of clusters identified
- Cluster sizes and quality metrics

**2. Marker Diagnostic Performance Table:**
```
Marker    Diagnosis            Sensitivity  Specificity  PPV    NPV    Accuracy
EMA       Synovial_Sarcoma     91%          82%          68%    96%    85%
CK7       Synovial_Sarcoma     52%          100%         100%   77%    81%
S100      MPNST                57%          54%          31%    77%    55%
Nestin    MPNST                78%          96%          86%    93%    92%
CD99      Ewing_Sarcoma        93%          43%          48%    91%    60%
Fli1      Ewing_Sarcoma        63%          78%          55%    82%    74%
```

**Key Insights:**
- CK7 has 100% specificity for Synovial Sarcoma (never false positive)
- Nestin is excellent for MPNST (high sensitivity + specificity)
- CD99 alone is insufficient for Ewing Sarcoma (low PPV)

**3. Optimal Antibody Panel Recommendations:**
```
Rank  Panel               Target Diagnosis      Sensitivity  Specificity  PPV    Performance  Recommendation
1     EMA + CK7           Synovial_Sarcoma      52%          100%         100%   0.803        Excellent - highly specific panel
2     S100 + Nestin       MPNST                 48%          100%         100%   0.787        Excellent - highly specific panel
3     CD99 + Fli1         Ewing_Sarcoma         56%          96%          88%    0.783        Good - reliable for diagnosis
```

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- Best panel for Synovial Sarcoma: EMA + CK7 (if both positive → 100% PPV)
- Best panel for MPNST: S100 + Nestin
- Best panel for Ewing Sarcoma: CD99 + Fli1

**4. Cases with Atypical Immunoprofiles:**
```
Case ID    Assigned Cluster  Silhouette  Quality Flag              Recommendation
SS015      Cluster 2         -0.05       Poor - misclassified      Strong outlier - review IHC, consider molecular testing
MPNST018   Cluster 1         0.08        Very low - ambiguous      Atypical immunoprofile - recommend molecular confirmation
EWS022     Cluster 3         0.18        Low - atypical            Borderline case - clinical correlation advised
```

**Action Items:**
- Review these cases' IHC slides
- Verify staining quality
- Check if molecular testing was truly confirmatory
- These cases may reduce prediction accuracy

### Step 2.6: Export Training Model Data

**IMPORTANT:** You need to save your training data file path for the prediction phase.

1. Note the **exact file path** to your training CSV:
   - Mac: `/Users/yourname/Documents/sarcoma_training_2025.csv`
   - Windows: `C:\Users\yourname\Documents\sarcoma_training_2025.csv`

2. **Do not modify this file** after training
   - If you need changes, create a new version with different filename
   - Re-run ihccluster analysis if you modify training data

---

## Phase 3: Query Dataset Preparation

### Step 3.1: Identify Query Cases

Select cases that meet **all** criteria:

✅ Diagnosis unknown or uncertain
✅ Same IHC panel as training dataset
✅ Adequate tissue quality
✅ Belong to same diagnostic differential

**DO NOT include:**
- ❌ Cases already in training dataset
- ❌ Cases with different IHC markers
- ❌ Cases outside your diagnostic differential
- ❌ Cases with known diagnoses (unless validating)

### Step 3.2: Create Query Data Spreadsheet

**Required columns:**
- `CaseID`: Unique identifier
- **Exact same marker columns as training dataset**
- **Do NOT include Diagnosis column** (this is what we're predicting)

**Example Query Dataset:**

```csv
CaseID,EMA,CK7,bcl2,CD56,S100,Nestin,NGFR,CD99,Fli1,Ki67_Percent,AR_Hscore
Query_001,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,Negative,18.2,210
Query_002,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,10.5,0
Query_003,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive,38.9,0
Query_004,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,25.1,150
Query_005,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,5.2,0
```

### Step 3.3: Marker Consistency Check

**Critical:** Query markers must **exactly match** training markers.

**Check these:**
✅ Same marker names (spelling, capitalization, underscores)
✅ Same data type (categorical vs continuous)
✅ Same scoring system (Positive/Negative format, H-score range, etc.)
✅ Same cutoffs for positivity

**Example of correct consistency:**

| Training Dataset | Query Dataset | Status |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| `EMA` (Positive/Negative) | `EMA` (Positive/Negative) | ✅ MATCH |
| `Ki67_Percent` (0-100) | `Ki67_Percent` (0-100) | ✅ MATCH |
| `AR_Hscore` (0-300) | `AR_Hscore` (0-300) | ✅ MATCH |

**Example of incorrect inconsistency:**

| Training Dataset | Query Dataset | Status |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| `EMA` (Positive/Negative) | `EMA` (pos/neg) | ❌ MISMATCH - different format |
| `Ki67_Percent` (0-100) | `Ki67_Hscore` (0-300) | ❌ MISMATCH - different marker |
| `CD99` (Positive/Negative) | Missing | ❌ MISMATCH - missing marker |

### Step 3.4: Save Query Dataset

1. Save as **CSV file**
2. Name descriptively: `sarcoma_query_batch1_2025.csv`
3. Remember file path
4. **Do not include diagnosis column**

---

## Phase 4: Running ihcpredict Analysis

### Step 4.1: Load Query Data into jamovi

1. Open jamovi (can be same or new instance)
2. Click **Open** → Load your query CSV file
3. Verify columns imported correctly
4. Check data types (same as training dataset)

### Step 4.2: Run ihcpredict Analysis

1. Click **Analyses** tab
2. Navigate to: **OncoPath** → **IHC Analysis** → **IHC Diagnostic Prediction**

### Step 4.3: Configure Analysis Settings

**Model Source:**
- Select: `Load training data from CSV file`
- (Stored model option not yet implemented)

**Training Data File (CSV):**
- Enter full path to training CSV file
- Example: `/Users/yourname/Documents/sarcoma_training_2025.csv`
- Use quotes if path contains spaces

**Diagnosis Column in Training Data:**
- Leave as `Diagnosis` (unless you named it differently)

**Categorical IHC Markers:**
- Select **exact same markers** as in ihccluster analysis
- Must be in same order (not required but helpful)

**Continuous IHC Markers:**
- Select **exact same continuous markers**

**Case ID (optional):**
- Select your case identifier column
- Helps track which predictions belong to which cases

### Step 4.4: Choose Prediction Method

**Recommendation: Use "Hybrid (rules + distance + cluster quality)"**

**Method Options:**

1. **Hybrid** (Recommended)
   - Combines all three approaches below
   - Most robust and accurate
   - Provides best confidence estimates

2. **Distance-based (nearest centroid)**
   - Uses similarity to average marker profile
   - Good for continuous data
   - Less interpretable

3. **Rule-based (optimal panels only)**
   - Uses if/then rules from panel analysis
   - Highly interpretable
   - May miss cases without perfect panel match

4. **Cluster membership (assign to nearest cluster)**
   - Uses cluster quality metrics
   - Good for well-separated groups

**Hybrid Method Weights:** (Advanced - leave defaults unless expert)
- Panel Match Weight: 0.5 (rule-based evidence)
- Distance Weight: 0.3 (similarity evidence)
- Cluster Quality Weight: 0.2 (membership evidence)

### Step 4.5: Set Confidence Thresholds

**Default Settings (Recommended):**
- High Confidence Threshold: 0.75
- Minimum Confidence Threshold: 0.50
- Low Confidence Threshold: 0.25

**Interpretation:**
- ≥0.75 = High confidence → Accept diagnosis
- 0.50-0.74 = Moderate confidence → Consider molecular testing
- 0.25-0.49 = Low confidence → Recommend molecular testing
- <0.25 = Very low confidence → Mandatory molecular testing

### Step 4.6: Enable Output Options

✅ **Show Alternative Diagnoses:** Check (default)
- Number of Alternatives: 3
- Shows differential diagnosis

✅ **Show Prediction Evidence:** Check (default)
- Explains WHY each diagnosis was predicted

✅ **Flag Low Confidence Cases:** Check (default)
- Creates separate table for problematic cases

✅ **Show Marker Comparison:** Check (default)
- Shows how query markers compare to expected values

✅ **Validate Marker Consistency:** Check (default)
- Automatically checks for mismatches

**Plots:**
✅ **Show Prediction Visualization:** Check
✅ **Show Confidence Distribution:** Check

### Step 4.7: Run Analysis

Click anywhere outside option panels to trigger analysis.

**Analysis will:**
1. Load training data
2. Validate marker consistency
3. Calculate predictions for each query case
4. Generate confidence scores
5. Produce output tables

**Progress indicator:** Watch for "Running..." message

AR_Hscore      YES              YES           YES              OK
```

**If you see WARNING or ERROR:**
- ERROR = Analysis cannot proceed (missing required marker)
- WARNING = Analysis will proceed but may be less accurate (extra marker or minor mismatch)

**Action if errors:**
1. Check spelling of marker names
2. Verify data types match
3. Ensure query dataset has all training markers
4. Fix query dataset and re-import

```

**How to Read This:**

**Query_001 Evidence:**
- ✅ Matched optimal panel: EMA + CK7 (both positive)
- ✅ Panel has 100% PPV in training data
- ✅ Close to Cluster 1 centroid (distance = 0.12, very close)
- ✅ Good silhouette score (0.68)
- **Conclusion:** Multiple lines of evidence support Synovial Sarcoma

**Query_004 Evidence:**
- ❌ No optimal panel match
- ⚠️ Assigned to Cluster 1, but far from centroid (distance = 0.55)
- ❌ Poor silhouette score (0.22) - borderline cluster membership
- **Conclusion:** Weak evidence, atypical immunoprofile

**Query_005 Evidence:**
- ❌ No optimal panel match
- ❌ Very far from centroid (distance = 0.78)
- ❌ Negative silhouette (-0.05) - **assigned to wrong cluster!**
- **Conclusion:** Outlier case, prediction unreliable

### Output 5: Low Confidence Cases (Review Required)

**Automatically flags problematic predictions:**

```
Case ID    Predicted Diagnosis  Confidence  Quality Flag              Primary Issue                Recommendation
Query_004  Synovial_Sarcoma     0.45        Low - atypical features   No optimal panel match       Strongly recommend molecular confirmation
Query_005  MPNST                0.18        Very low - ambiguous      Poor cluster membership      Mandatory molecular testing - review IHC staining quality
```

**This table requires immediate attention:**
- These cases should be discussed at tumor board
- Molecular testing is mandatory or strongly recommended
- Review IHC slides for technical issues
- Consider clinical context and imaging findings

### Output 6: Marker Expression Comparison

**Shows how query case markers compare to expected values for predicted diagnosis:**

**Example for Query_004 (Predicted: Synovial Sarcoma, Low Confidence):**

```
Marker         Query Value  Expected for Synovial Sarcoma  Match Status

Ki67_Percent   25.1         18.5                           Different
```

**Interpretation:**
- Query case is **CK7 negative** but Synovial Sarcoma typically CK7 positive
- Query case shows **Nestin positivity** which is unusual for Synovial Sarcoma
- These mismatches explain the low confidence score
- **Clinical significance:** Atypical Synovial Sarcoma vs. wrong diagnosis
- **Action:** Molecular testing required (SYT-SSX fusion)

### Output 7: Prediction Summary Statistics

**Overall performance across all query cases:**

```
Statistic               Value

High Confidence         2 (40.0%)
Moderate Confidence     1 (20.0%)
Low Confidence          1 (20.0%)
Very Low Confidence     1 (20.0%)
Mean Confidence         0.628
Median Confidence       0.720
```

**Interpretation:**
- 40% of predictions are high confidence (acceptable rate)
- 40% require molecular testing (low + very low)
- Mean confidence 0.628 suggests moderate overall certainty

**If mean confidence < 0.50:**
- Training dataset may not represent query cases well
- Consider expanding training dataset
- Verify IHC protocols are consistent

### Output 8: Confidence by Diagnosis

**Confidence broken down by predicted diagnosis:**

```
Predicted Diagnosis   N Cases  Mean Confidence  Median Confidence  Min  Max  N High Conf  N Low Conf
Synovial_Sarcoma      2        0.67             0.67               0.45  0.88  1            1
MPNST                 2        0.45             0.45               0.18  0.72  0            1
Ewing_Sarcoma         1        0.91             0.91               0.91  0.91  1            0
```

**Interpretation:**
- Ewing Sarcoma predictions are most confident (0.91 mean)
- MPNST predictions are least confident (0.45 mean)
- May indicate MPNST has more variable immunoprofiles
- Consider adding more MPNST cases to training set

```

### When to Order Molecular Testing

**MANDATORY (Do not proceed without):**
- ✅ Any Very Low Confidence prediction (<0.25)
- ✅ Negative silhouette score
- ✅ Primary and alternative diagnoses within 0.10 confidence of each other
- ✅ Clinical decision impacts treatment plan
- ✅ Atypical marker expression pattern

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:**
- ⚠️ Low Confidence (0.25-0.49)
- ⚠️ No optimal panel match
- ⚠️ Multiple marker mismatches with expected profile
- ⚠️ Clinically unexpected result

**CONSIDER:**
- 🤔 Moderate Confidence (0.50-0.74) with treatment implications
- 🤔 Academic/research setting requiring confirmation
- 🤔 Medico-legal case requiring documentation

**NOT REQUIRED:**
- ✅ High Confidence (≥0.75) with optimal panel match
- ✅ Perfect match to expected marker profile
- ✅ Silhouette >0.50
- ✅ Clinical presentation consistent with prediction

### Documenting Predictions in Reports

**Template for High Confidence Cases:**

> **Case Query_001 - Core needle biopsy, soft tissue mass, left thigh**
>
> **Immunohistochemistry:** EMA (positive, diffuse), CK7 (positive, focal), bcl-2 (positive), CD56 (negative), S100 (negative), Nestin (negative), NGFR (positive), CD99 (positive), Fli-1 (negative), Ki-67 proliferation index 18%
>
> **Computational Diagnostic Analysis:** Using a validated machine-learning algorithm trained on 75 molecularly confirmed sarcomas, the immunohistochemical profile predicts **synovial sarcoma** with high confidence (prediction score 0.88, optimal panel match EMA+/CK7+ with 100% positive predictive value). The marker expression pattern closely matches the training cohort centroid for synovial sarcoma (distance score 0.12, silhouette coefficient 0.68).
>
> **Diagnosis:** High-grade spindle cell sarcoma, consistent with **SYNOVIAL SARCOMA**
>
> **Comment:** The immunophenotype (EMA+/CK7+) is characteristic for synovial sarcoma. Molecular confirmation with RT-PCR for SYT-SSX fusion is recommended for definitive diagnosis.

**Template for Low Confidence Cases:**

> **Case Query_004 - Core needle biopsy, soft tissue mass, right forearm**
>
> **Immunohistochemistry:** EMA (positive), CK7 (negative), bcl-2 (positive), CD56 (positive), S100 (negative), Nestin (positive), NGFR (negative), CD99 (positive), Fli-1 (negative), Ki-67 proliferation index 25%
>
> **Computational Diagnostic Analysis:** Using a validated machine-learning algorithm, the immunohistochemical profile suggests synovial sarcoma as the primary prediction (score 0.45), but with **low confidence**. Alternative diagnoses include malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST, score 0.38). The marker expression pattern shows atypical features with CK7 negativity (expected positive for synovial sarcoma) and aberrant nestin positivity. No optimal diagnostic panel match was identified.
>
> **Diagnosis:** High-grade spindle cell sarcoma, favor **SYNOVIAL SARCOMA** versus **MPNST**
>
> **Comment:** The immunoprofile is atypical and does not strongly support a specific diagnosis. **Molecular testing is mandatory** to distinguish between synovial sarcoma (SYT-SSX fusion) and MPNST (loss of H3K27me3, NF1 alterations). This case will be discussed at the multidisciplinary sarcoma tumor board.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "Error loading training model: Training file not found"

**Cause:** File path is incorrect or file was moved/renamed

**Solutions:**
1. Check file path spelling (copy-paste is safer than typing)
2. Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows
3. Put path in quotes if it contains spaces: `"/Users/name/my folder/file.csv"`
4. Verify file still exists in that location
5. Check file extension is `.csv` (not `.xlsx` or `.txt`)

### Problem 2: Marker Validation shows ERROR status

**Cause:** Mismatch between training and query markers

**Solutions:**
1. Check spelling of marker names (case-sensitive)
2. Verify data type (categorical vs continuous)
3. Ensure query has ALL training markers
4. Check for extra spaces in column names
5. Re-export both datasets with consistent naming

### Problem 3: All predictions have very low confidence

**Causes:**
- Query cases are very different from training cases
- Different IHC protocols/antibodies used
- Different scoring methods
- Training dataset too small

**Solutions:**
1. Review whether query cases belong to same diagnostic differential
2. Verify IHC antibodies and protocols match
3. Check that scoring methods are identical
4. Expand training dataset (aim for 30+ cases per diagnosis)
5. Consider re-staining query cases with same protocol

### Problem 4: Predictions contradict morphology

**Example:** Algorithm predicts Ewing Sarcoma but morphology shows spindle cells

**Actions:**
1. **Trust morphology over algorithm** - algorithms complement, don't replace, pathologist expertise
2. Review IHC slides for staining artifacts
3. Check if case might be outside training differential
4. Consider unusual/rare variant
5. Mandatory molecular testing
6. Discuss at tumor board

### Problem 5: No optimal panel match for any cases

**Causes:**
- Query cases have different marker patterns
- Training dataset doesn't capture all variants
- Scoring cutoffs differ between datasets

**Solutions:**
1. Review marker comparison table for patterns
2. Consider expanding training dataset with more diverse cases
3. Verify scoring consistency (e.g., same % cutoff for "Positive")
4. Use distance-based method instead of rules-based
5. Accept that some cases are truly atypical

Overall Accuracy: 13/15 (87%)
High Confidence Accuracy (≥0.75): 9/9 (100%)
Moderate/Low Confidence Accuracy: 4/6 (67%)
```

**Analysis of Errors:**

**Val_06: True MPNST → Predicted Synovial Sarcoma (0.55)**
- Review showed: EMA+ (unusual for MPNST), S100+ (typical)
- Molecular: Confirmed MPNST (H3K27me3 loss)
- **Lesson:** Some MPNSTs can be aberrantly EMA+
- **Action:** Added case to training set with annotation

**Val_13: True Ewing Sarcoma → Predicted MPNST (0.48)**
- Review showed: CD99+ but Fli-1 negative (rare variant)
- Molecular: Confirmed Ewing with EWSR1-FLI1 fusion
- **Lesson:** Some Ewing variants lack Fli-1 nuclear expression
- **Action:** Low confidence correctly flagged for molecular testing

**Conclusion:** Algorithm performs excellently for high-confidence predictions (100% accuracy). Low-confidence cases appropriately flag atypical variants requiring molecular confirmation.

### Phase 4: Prospective Implementation

**Date:** May 2025 - Present

**Protocol:**
1. All spindle cell sarcoma core biopsies receive standard IHC panel
2. After pathologist review, cases entered into prediction algorithm
3. Algorithmic prediction reviewed alongside morphology
4. Molecular testing triggered automatically for:
   - Low confidence predictions (<0.50)
   - Silhouette score <0.10
   - Discordance between morphology and prediction

**First 3 Months Results (20 consecutive cases):**

```
Confidence Level     N Cases  Molecular Testing Done  Final Dx Concordance
High (≥0.75)         12       2 (for research)        12/12 (100%)
Moderate (0.50-0.74) 5        4 (clinical request)    5/5 (100%)
Low (0.25-0.49)      2        2 (mandatory)           2/2 (100%)
Very Low (<0.25)     1        1 (mandatory)           0/1 (0%) *
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                20       9 (45%)                 19/20 (95%)
```

*Very low confidence case turned out to be leiomyosarcoma (outside training differential)

**Clinical Impact:**

1. **Reduced molecular testing utilization:**
   - Pre-implementation: 80% of cases received molecular testing
   - Post-implementation: 45% of cases received molecular testing
   - **Cost savings:** $15,000 per month

2. **Faster turnaround time:**
   - High confidence cases: Signed out same day (no molecular testing delay)
   - Low confidence cases: Molecular testing ordered immediately (not delayed)

3. **Improved diagnostic confidence:**
   - Pathologists report increased confidence when algorithm agrees
   - Reduces second-opinion requests

4. **Educational value:**
   - Trainees learn expected immunoprofiles
   - Outlier cases identified for teaching files

**Challenges Encountered:**

1. **One case outside training differential** (leiomyosarcoma)
   - Very low confidence correctly flagged it as atypical
   - Expanded training set to include leiomyosarcoma (n=15)

2. **Technical variability in external referrals**
   - Some referring hospitals use different antibody clones
   - Solution: Note in report that prediction assumes standard antibodies

3. **Initial skepticism from clinicians**
   - Concern about "replacing pathologists with AI"
   - Solution: Education sessions explaining algorithm as decision support tool

### Lessons Learned

✅ **What Worked Well:**
1. Validation study built confidence before implementation
2. Automatic flagging of low-confidence cases prevented errors
3. Cost savings from reduced molecular testing gained administrative support
4. Integration into tumor board discussions improved multidisciplinary care

⚠️ **What Could Be Improved:**
1. Initial training set could have been larger (75 → aim for 100+)
2. Should have included more rare variants
3. Documentation in pathology reports needed standardization
4. Staff training required more time than expected

🎯 **Future Plans:**
1. Expand training set to 150+ cases (2025-2026)
2. Add additional diagnoses (leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma)
3. Develop multi-institutional validation study
4. Publish results in diagnostic pathology journal

## Conclusion

This IHC diagnostic prediction workflow represents a powerful tool for diagnostic pathology, but it requires:

1. **Careful training data curation** - quality matters more than quantity
2. **Rigorous validation** - test before implementation
3. **Appropriate confidence thresholds** - know when to trust predictions
4. **Mandatory molecular confirmation** - algorithm assists, doesn't replace
5. **Ongoing quality monitoring** - track outcomes and update training data

**The algorithm is a decision support tool, not a diagnostic replacement. Pathologist expertise, morphology, clinical context, and molecular confirmation remain the cornerstones of diagnostic accuracy.**

**When used appropriately, computational IHC analysis can:**
- ✅ Improve diagnostic accuracy
- ✅ Reduce unnecessary molecular testing
- ✅ Accelerate turnaround time
- ✅ Provide objective evidence for complex cases
- ✅ Enhance trainee education

**Remember:**
- High confidence predictions with optimal panel matches are reliable
- Low confidence predictions require molecular testing
- Outliers teach us about biological variability
- Algorithm performance improves with larger, more diverse training sets

**Contact your local bioinformatician or pathology informatics specialist for assistance with implementation.**
