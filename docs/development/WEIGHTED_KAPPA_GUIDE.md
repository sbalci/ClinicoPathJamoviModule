# Weighted Kappa Interpretation Guide - Implementation Summary

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Feature:** Automatic weighted kappa interpretation guide
**Function:** `agreement`

---

## Overview

Added an automatic, context-sensitive interpretation guide that appears when users select weighted kappa methods (Equal/Linear or Squared). This helps users understand the weighting scheme, when to use it, and how to interpret results.

---

## Implementation

### 1. New Output Added (.r.yaml)

**Location:** `jamovi/agreement.r.yaml` lines 163-166

```yaml
- name: weightedKappaGuide
  title: "Weighted Kappa Interpretation Guide"
  type: Html
  visible: (wght:unweighted == false)
```

**Visibility:** Automatically appears when user selects "Equal/Linear" or "Squared" weights

---

### 2. Helper Method Added (.b.R)

**Location:** `R/agreement.b.R` lines 25-179

**Method:** `.createWeightedKappaGuide(weight_type)`

**Features:**
- Generates different content for "equal" vs "squared" weights
- Includes weighting formulas with explanations
- Provides example weight tables for 5-point scales
- Explains when to use each method
- Lists key interpretation points
- Warns about comparing weighted vs unweighted kappa
- Includes Landis & Koch (1977) interpretation guidelines

---

### 3. Population Logic (.b.R)

**Location:** `R/agreement.b.R` lines 107-111

```r
# Weighted Kappa Guide (if using weights) ----
if (wght != "unweighted") {
    weight_guide <- self$.createWeightedKappaGuide(wght)
    self$results$weightedKappaGuide$setContent(weight_guide)
}
```

## Content Structure

### For Linear (Equal) Weights

**Formula:** `Weight = 1 - |i - j| / (k - 1)`

**Example Table (5-point scale):**

| Distance | Example | Weight | Penalty |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 0 (agreement) | 1 vs 1 | 1.00 | None |
| 1 category | 1 vs 2 | 0.75 | Small |
| 2 categories | 1 vs 3 | 0.50 | Moderate |
| Maximum | 1 vs 5 | 0.00 | Full |

**When to use:** Equal-interval scales (e.g., Likert scales)

**Key points:**
- Adjacent disagreements receive partial credit
- Distant disagreements receive no credit
- Penalty increases linearly with distance
- Weighted kappa will be higher than unweighted when most disagreements are adjacent

---

### For Squared (Quadratic) Weights

**Formula:** `Weight = 1 - [(i - j) / (k - 1)]²`

**Example Table (5-point scale):**

| Distance | Example | Weight | Penalty |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 0 (agreement) | 1 vs 1 | 1.00 | None |
| 1 category | 1 vs 2 | 0.94 | Very small |
| 2 categories | 1 vs 3 | 0.75 | Moderate |
| Maximum | 1 vs 5 | 0.00 | Full |

**When to use:** Severity-weighted scales (e.g., clinical severity, diagnostic accuracy)

**Key points:**
- Adjacent disagreements receive much more credit than linear (0.94 vs 0.75)
- Distant disagreements are heavily penalized
- Penalty increases exponentially with distance
- Weighted kappa will be substantially higher than unweighted when disagreements cluster near diagonal
- Special property: Squared weights equal ICC under certain conditions

## Visual Design

### Color Coding

- **Main container:** Light gray background with green left border
- **Formula box:** White background with monospace font, pink highlight
- **When to use box:** Light green background
- **Warning box:** Yellow background with gold border
- **Tables:** Bordered, alternating row colors

### Typography

- Section headers: Bold, dark gray (`#2c3e50`)
- Body text: 13px, regular weight
- Formula: 14px, monospace, code-style (`#c7254e`)
- Interpretation guidelines: 12px, gray (`#666`)
