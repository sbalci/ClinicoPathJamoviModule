## 🧠 CRITICAL EVALUATION OF STATISTICAL METHODS

**Overall Rating**: 🔴 Major concerns (Score: 3.5/18)

**Summary**: The study addresses a clinically relevant question about Ki-67-based subgrading of WHO G2 pNETs and uses the correct general framework (Kaplan-Meier + Cox regression). However, critical methodological deficiencies — absent proportional hazards testing, univariate screening for model building, unreported missing data, no internal validation, and dangerously small subgroups (G3 n=7) — undermine confidence in the reported hazard ratios. The Ki-67 "eyeballing" assessment method introduces unmeasured classification error at precisely the cutpoints that define the study groups.

### Checklist

| Aspect | Assessment | Evidence (section/page) | Recommendation |
|---|:--:|---|---|
| Design–method alignment | 🟡 | Methods: t-test/ANOVA used without normality check; G3 n=7 too small for parametric tests | Use non-parametric alternatives (Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher-Freeman-Halton); consider ordinal trend tests |
| Assumptions & diagnostics | 🔴 | Methods: No PH testing, no normality testing, no variance homogeneity check | Test Schoenfeld residuals for ALL Cox models; report log-log plots; add Shapiro-Wilk for continuous variables |
| Sample size & power | 🔴 | Results: G2b n=18, G3 n=7; EPV likely <5 for G3 subgroup | Report events per group; use Firth penalized Cox; acknowledge power limitation; consider collapsing G2b+G3 |
| Multiplicity control | 🔴 | Results: 6 pairwise log-rank tests per endpoint × 3 endpoints = 18 comparisons uncorrected | Apply Holm-Bonferroni to pairwise comparisons; designate primary endpoint; report adjusted p-values |
| Model specification & confounding | 🔴 | Methods: Univariate p<0.05 screening; no DAG; Ki-67 and mitotic count highly correlated | Pre-specify covariates based on clinical knowledge; check VIF; consider LASSO-Cox; present DAG |
| Missing data handling | 🔴 | Not mentioned anywhere in manuscript | Report missing data table; compare complete vs incomplete cases; use MICE if >5% missing |
| Effect sizes & CIs | 🟡 | Tables 2–4: HRs with 95% CIs reported; but no effect sizes for group comparisons; no median survival CIs | Report Cohen's d for continuous, Cramér's V for categorical; median survival with CIs; RMST differences |
| Validation & calibration | 🔴 | Absent | Bootstrap C-index (B≥200); calibration plot; compare against WHO grade alone and AJCC stage alone |
| Reproducibility/transparency | 🔴 | Methods: SPSS 26.0 + R 4.2.3 stated, but no R packages specified; no data/code availability | Specify R packages; provide STROBE checklist; data availability statement; reproducible code |

### Scoring Rubric

| Aspect | Score (0–2) | Badge |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Design–method alignment | 1 | 🟡 |
| Assumptions & diagnostics | 0 | 🔴 |
| Sample size & power | 0.5 | 🔴 |
| Multiplicity control | 0 | 🔴 |
| Model specification & confounding | 0.5 | 🔴 |
| Missing data handling | 0 | 🔴 |
| Effect sizes & CIs | 1 | 🟡 |
| Validation & calibration | 0 | 🔴 |
| Reproducibility/transparency | 0.5 | 🔴 |

**Total Score**: 3.5/18 → Overall Badge: 🔴 Weak

### Red Flags Identified

1. **Chi-square with expected counts < 5**: G3 (n=7) virtually guarantees expected counts <5 in most cross-tabulations.
2. **Unadjusted multiple pairwise tests**: 6 pairwise comparisons per endpoint × 3 endpoints with no correction.
3. **Stepwise-like regression without validation**: Univariate screening (p<0.05) is the most criticized variable selection approach (Harrell 2015).
4. **PH violations not checked**: Cox model results uninterpretable without PH verification.
5. **Overfitting risk**: Events-per-variable likely < 5 for G3; separation risk in logistic/Cox models.
6. **Reporting only p-values without effect sizes**: Group comparisons in Table 1 report only p-values.
7. **Ki-67 "eyeballing"**: Published inter-observer kappa 0.45–0.72 for visual Ki-67 estimation. Non-differential misclassification biases grade-based HRs toward the null.

### Critical Concern: Ki-67 Eyeballing Method

The entire study classification relies on visual Ki-67 estimation — the least reproducible method available:
- Inter-observer kappa ranges 0.45–0.72 across published studies
- The 10% cutpoint (G2a vs G2b) is particularly difficult to estimate visually
- WHO 2022 recommends digital image analysis or manual counting over visual estimation
- Non-differential misclassification at cutpoints biases HRs toward the null, potentially masking real grade differences
- No inter-observer reliability was measured despite two pathologists assessing Ki-67

## 🔎 GAP ANALYSIS (WHAT'S MISSING)

### ~~Gap 1: Trend Test for Ordinal Groups~~ — NOW IMPLEMENTED
- **Method**: Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test
- **Impact**: G1→G2a→G2b→G3 is ordinal; testing for monotonic trends across ordered grades is more powerful and appropriate than omnibus ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis
- **Implementation**: Jonckheere-Terpstra test now fully implemented in `nonparametric` function (was a stub returning NA, now uses `DescTools::JonckheereTerpstraTest`). Also implemented: Median test, Van der Waerden test, Mood's Median test, Cochran's Q, Page's trend test, McNemar test, Sign test.
- **Status**: COMPLETE — select `test_type = "jonckheere_terpstra"` in the nonparametric function

### ~~Gap 2: Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST)~~ — ALREADY COVERED
- **Method**: RMST difference between groups — PH-free alternative to HRs
- **Impact**: When PH assumption is violated (likely in pNETs with heterogeneous natural history), RMST provides unbiased comparison
- **ClinicoPath functions**: `rmst` (RMST tests) and `rmstregression` (RMST regression models) — both already exist as standalone functions
- **Status**: No implementation needed

### Gap 3: Sensitivity Analysis for Misclassification Bias
- **Method**: Probabilistic bias analysis for non-differential measurement error (Ki-67 visual estimation)
- **Impact**: This article's central classification depends on a method with documented inter-observer variability (kappa ~0.5–0.7). Quantifying the impact of misclassification on reported HRs is critical.
- **Closest existing function**: None
- **Exact missing options**: Misclassification sensitivity analysis tool with user-specified kappa and reclassification probabilities

### Gap 4: DAG-Based Confounder Selection
- **Method**: Visual causal diagram (DAG) for identifying confounders, mediators, and colliders
- **Impact**: The study adjusts for LN metastasis, which may be a mediator (on the causal pathway from grade to outcome), causing overadjustment bias
- **Closest existing function**: None
- **Exact missing options**: Interactive DAG builder → identified confounder set

```

**Dependencies**: `DescTools` (already imported) or `clinfun`
**Validation**: Simulate ordered groups with known monotonic trend; verify power > Kruskal-Wallis

---

### ~~Target 2: RMST~~ — Already implemented as `rmst` and `rmstregression` functions. No changes needed.

---

## 🧪 TEST PLAN

### Unit Tests
- **Trend test**: Simulated ordered groups (n=200, 80, 18, 7) with known monotonic effect; verify p < 0.05 and correct direction
- **RMST**: Use `survival::veteran` dataset; verify RMST difference matches `survRM2::rmst2()` output
- **Edge cases**: G3 with n=7 (all events vs all censored); ties in survival times; zero events in a group

### Assumption Reporting
- Confirm `coxdiagnostics` correctly identifies PH violations in simulated data with time-varying HR
- Verify `tableone` auto-selects non-parametric tests when group size < 30

### Reproducibility
- Provide example scripts that reproduce all article analyses using ClinicoPath functions
- Save options JSON for each analysis step

## ✅ HOW CLINICOPATH COULD REPRODUCE THIS ANALYSIS (BETTER)

If a user wanted to reproduce and improve this study's analyses using ClinicoPath:

1. **`tableone`** → Table 1 with auto-selection of non-parametric tests for non-normal distributions and small groups
2. **`nonparametric`** → Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-hoc (corrected) instead of ANOVA for 4-group continuous comparisons
3. **`conttables`** → Chi-square/Fisher's exact with Cramér's V effect sizes
4. **`survival`** → KM curves + log-rank with weighted variants + pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) + 1/3/5-year rates with CIs + univariate and multivariable Cox + calibration curves + bootstrap C-index + RCS for continuous predictors
5. **`coxdiagnostics`** → Schoenfeld residuals, log-log plots, deviance residuals, influential observations
6. **`concordanceindex`** → Discrimination (C-index with bootstrap CIs)
7. **`firthregression`** → Penalized Cox for G3 subgroup (n=7) to avoid separation
8. **`consortdiagram`** → Patient flow from 326 → 300
9. **`effectsize`** → Cohen's d, Cramér's V, eta-squared for all group comparisons
10. **`advancedimputation`** → MICE for any missing data
11. **`rmst`** → RMST differences as PH-free alternative to hazard ratios
12. **`rmstregression`** → RMST regression for adjusted RMST comparisons

This pipeline would address virtually all identified statistical weaknesses while being reproducible within the ClinicoPath/jamovi framework.
