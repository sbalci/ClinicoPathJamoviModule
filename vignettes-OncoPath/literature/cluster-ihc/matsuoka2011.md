Background and Objectives: Intercellular adhesion mediated by the claudin and cadherin/catenin complex is a prerequisite for epithelial integrity
and differentiation, and has been suggested to be frequently disturbed in cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between such
abnormality and clinicopathological features of colorectal carcinomas.
Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of claudin-1 and -4, E-cadherin, and b-catenin was performed on a series of 156 cases.
Results: Signi?cant positive associations (P < 0.05û0.001) were found with immunoreactivity for each except nuclear b-catenin. Reduced
expression was correlated with poor tumor differentiation (claudin-1, P ╝ 0.035; claudin-4, P ╝ 0.011; E-cadherin, P < 0.001; membranous
b-catenin, P ╝ 0.002), an advanced TNM stage (claudin-1, P ╝ 0.002; claudin-4, P ╝ 0.008), and a poor prognosis. On multivariate analysis,
reduced expression of E-cadherin (P < 0.001) and b-catenin (P ╝ 0.048) at invasive fronts proved to be an independent predictor of short survival.
Hierarchical cluster analysis identi?ed three distinct groups with a good, intermediate, and poor prognosis, having an independent survival outcome
by multivariate analysis (good or intermediate vs. poor: hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% con?dence interval, 1.54û4.60; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Disruption of cell adhesion molecules correlates with tumor differentiation and progression in colorectal carcinomas. Speci?c marker
pro?les were identi?ed here as independent prognostic indicators.

INTRODUCTION

Epithelial cells are tightly interconnected mainly through adherens
and tight junctions. However, these may exhibit loss of their function in
cancer cells that manifest high metastatic potential. Adherens structural
components have been a major focus of cancer studies, and expression
of E-cadherin and a-, b-, and g-catenin, in particular, is altered in
colorectal carcinomas [1û6]. In addition, b-catenin plays a pivotal role
in the Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of the Wnt signaling cascade,
due to either inactivating mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli or
activating mutations in the gene encoding b-catenin, is observed in the
majority of colorectal carcinomas [7]. A number of integral membrane
proteins associated with tight junctions have also been identi?ed,
including the claudin family consisting of approximately 20 members
[8]. Recent gene expression pro?ling analyses have shown that claudin
gene expression is frequently altered in various cancers [9]. As with
adherens junction proteins, the roles of claudins have recently attracted
attention in colorectal carcinomas [10û15].

The present study was undertaken to immunohistochemically inves-
tigate expression of claudin-1 and -4, E-cadherin, and b-catenin in a
series of colorectal carcinomas. The encoded protein levels in different
tumor portions, that is, ææcentral partsÆÆ and ææinvasive fronts,ÆÆ were also
evaluated. Clustered expression of these markers in different tumor
regions de?nes groups of colorectal carcinomas with speci?c pheno-
types and distinct clinical outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients and Materials

Organization Sagamihara Hospital (Kanagawa, Japan) between April
1996 and March 2001. Surgically resected specimens were ?xed in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraf?n wax, according to routine pro-
cedures, and sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Patients with familial polyposis coli, hereditary non-polyposis
colorectal carcinoma, multiple colorectal carcinomas, or in?ammatory
bowel disease, or those who had died within 30 days of surgery were not
included in the analysis. No patient received initial chemotherapy or
radiotherapy. The 156 patients comprised 99 males and 57 females, with
a mean/median age of 65/66 years (range: 22û86). Informed consent
was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the clinical
research and ethics committee of the hospital.

Pathological Review

Slides stained with H&E were examined by an experienced gastro-
intestinal pathologist (H.M.). Proximal cancers were classi?ed as
tumors proximal to the splenic ?exure and the remaining tumors were
de?ned as distal. The depth of invasion (pT category), lymph node
involvement (pN category), and pathological staging of all surgically
resected tumors were assessed according to the UICC/TNM

classi?cation [16]. Out of 156 patients, 73 were diagnosed pathologi-
cally to have TNM stage II lesions, 58 stage III, and 25 stage IV.

Two tumor compartments were regularly evaluated in each case. One
was represented by the deepest fourth (corresponding to the ææinvasive
frontÆÆ), while the other was represented by the super?cial luminal
border to deepest third (corresponding to the ææcentral partÆÆ of the
tumor), modi?ed after the description by Palmqvist et al. [17].

Adjuvant Chemotherapy and Follow-Up

In 48 out of the 58 stage III patients, postoperative oral adminis-
tration of 5-?uorouracil (5-FU) derivatives was given for at least 1 year.
In 13 out of 25 stage IV cases, 5-FU plus mitomycin C or leukovorin
were applied by intravenous infusion biweekly after surgery. All
patients were followed up regularly by physical and blood examinations
with mandatory screening by colonoscopy, ultrasound, computed tom-
ography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Locoregional recurrence was
de?ned as a tumor occurring at the anastomosis or in the locoregional
lymph nodes, retroperitoneum, or pelvic wall. Distant recurrences were
de?ned as tumor manifestations outside the site of resection in the
peritoneal cavity or other organs. The patients were observed for more
than 5 years, and the median and mean duration of follow-up were 73
and 79 months (range: 60û120) for the survivors alive at the date of their
last visit (n ╝ 86).

Immunohistochemistry

performed with

Immunostaining was

a DakoCytomation
Autostainer Instrument (DakoCytomation, Kyoto, Japan). Brie?y,
4 mm thick tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated
in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Endogeneous peroxidase
activity was blocked by incubation with peroxidase-blocking solution
(DakoCytomation) for 5 min. Antigen retrieval consisted of autoclave
treatment of sections for 30 min in Target Retrieval Solution (pH 6.0,
DakoCytomation).

The primary antibodies employed were polyclonal anti-claudin-1
(E3411, prediluted, Spring Bioscience, Fremont, CA), polyclonal anti-
claudin-4 (E3981, prediluted, Spring Bioscience), monoclonal anti-E-
cadherin (NCH-38, 1:200, DakoCytomation), and monoclonal anti-b-
catenin (CAT-5H10, 1:400, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San
Francisco, CA), with incubation for 30 min at room temperature.
Using an Envision Kit, the slides were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated with secondary antibody for
30 min and then with substrate-chromogen (diaminobenzidine)
solution, followed by light counterstaining with MayerÆs hematoxylin.
In each case, normal colorectal mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma was
used as an internal positive control for claudins-1 and -4, E-cadherin,
and b-catenin. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were
omitted.

Assessment of Immunostaining

Distinct membranous staining for claudin-1 and -4, E-cadherin, and
b-catenin was considered to be positive, regardless of the staining
intensity. Cytoplasmic or nuclear immunoreactivity for claudin-1 and
-4 and E-cadherin was ignored. Loss of expression was classi?ed into
three grades: mild, <1/3 of each tumor compartment, that is, central part
or invasive front, showing loss of staining; moderate, 1/3û2/3 of each
tumor compartment showing loss of staining; marked, >2/3 of each
tumor compartment showing loss of staining. Additionally, aberrant
nuclear staining for b-catenin was separately evaluated. Percentage
nuclear staining was evaluated in most representative areas showing
highest immunoreactivity, regardless of the tumor compartment, by
counting the number of positive cells among 1,000 tumor cells.
Then, aberrant b-catenin expression was classi?ed into three grades:

non-expresser, <5%; low expresser, 5û20%; high expresser, >20%.
Immunoreactivity was evaluated independently by two of the authors
(T.M. and H.M.) without prior knowledge of clinicopathological data.

Statistical Analysis

To assess agreement between the two interpreters in immunohisto-
chemistry, k coef?cients were calculated excluding nuclear expression
of b-catenin. Correlation of nuclear positivity for b-catenin between the
two interpreters was assessed by the SpearmanÆs rank correlation coef-
?cient. Categorical analysis of variables was performed using either the
chi-squared test (with YatesÆ correction) or the FisherÆs exact test, as
appropriate. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the immunohistochemical
results was achieved using WardÆs methods. Cancer-related survival
time was measured from the date of surgery to the end of follow-up or
death due to colorectal cancer or other causes. Recurrence-free survival
time was de?ned as the time from surgery to recurrent disease (alive) or
death, with or without recurrence. Survival curves were generated by the
KaplanûMeier method. The in?uence of each variable on survival was
assessed using univariate and multivariate CoxÆs regression analyses. In
the CoxÆs multivariate analysis, a step-wise backward variable elimin-
ation method was used with an entry limit of P < 0.1 and a removal
limit of P (cid:1) 0.05. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically sig-
ni?cant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS II version
11.0J for Windows (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

RESULTS

Expression of Claudin-1 and -4, E-Cadherin,
and b-Catenin

Expression of claudin-1 and -4, E-cadherin, and b-catenin is illus-
trated in Figure 1. Normal colorectal epithelium exhibited circumfer-
ential membranous staining for claudin-1 and -4, E-cadherin, and b-
catenin without any nuclear staining. The staining of colorectal carci-
nomas for claudin-1 and -4 and E-cadherin was similar to that seen for
normal epithelium, namely with a circumferential membranous pattern.
A few tumors showed weak nuclear staining for claudin-1 (4 cases, 3%),
claudin-4 (3 cases, 2%), and E-cadherin (7 cases, 5%). For b-catenin
expression, a reciprocal relationship between membranous and nuclear
staining was observed in some tumor samples.

In the central parts of tumors, mild loss of claudin-1 membranous
expression was detected in 32 (21%) out of 156 tumors, moderate loss in
64 (41%), and marked loss in 60 (38%); the concordance rate between
the two observers was 95.5% (k ╝ 0.93), indicating almost perfect
agreement. At the invasive fronts, mild loss of claudin-1 was seen in
32 (21%), moderate loss in 38 (24%), and marked loss in 86 (55%);
concordance between the two observers was 94.9% (k ╝ 0.92). For
claudin-4 expression in the central parts, 57 (36%), 62 (40%), and 37
(24%) demonstrated mild, moderate, and marked loss, respectively.
Concordance between the two observers was 89.1% (k ╝ 0.83). At
the invasive fronts, 73 (47%), 32 (20%), and 51 (33%) demonstrated
mild, moderate, and marked loss of claudin-4 expression, respectively.
Concordance between the two observers was 90.4% (k ╝ 0.84).

For E-cadherin expression in the central parts, there were 68 (43%)
tumors with mild loss, 40 (26%) with moderate loss, and 48 (31%) with
marked loss (86.5% concordance, k ╝ 0.80; substantial agreement). At
the invasive fronts, there were 57 (37%) tumors with mild loss of E-
cadherin, 32 (20%) with moderate loss, and 67 (43%) with marked loss
(94.2% concordance, k ╝ 0.91). For membranous b-catenin expression
in the central parts, most (108/156, 69%) cases displayed mild loss, and
with 25 (16%) and 23 (15%) cases demonstrating moderate and marked
loss, respectively (98.1% concordance, k ╝ 0.96). Similar to the central
parts, most (94/156, 60%) tumors at the invasive fronts exhibited mild
loss, and remaining 28 (18%) and 34 (22%) cases featured moderate and

marked loss, respectively (96.8% concordance, k ╝ 0.94). For nuclear
b-catenin, there were 69 (44%) non-expressers, 44 (28%) with low, and
43 (28%) with high levels; signi?cant correlation was found between the
two observers (SpearmanÆs r ╝ 0.918; P < 0.0001).

When immunohistochemical results for claudin-1 and -4, E-cad-
herin, and membranous b-catenin were strati?ed into two groups, that is,
mild loss and moderate to marked loss, no signi?cant difference in
survival was found using CoxÆs regression analyses. Similarly,

immunoreactivity of nuclear b-catenin was strati?ed into two groups,
that is, non- or low- and high-expressers.

signi?cant positive relationships were demonstrated
between central parts and invasive fronts (P < 0.001). In addition,
signi?cant positive associations (P < 0.05û0.001) were found between
each with immunoreactivity for all proteins except nuclear b-catenin.

Relationship Between Immunoreactivity and
Clinicopathological Parameters

Moderate to marked loss of claudin-1 at invasive fronts was more
frequent in poorer differentiated tumor (P ╝ 0.035). Moderate to

marked loss of claudin-1 in central parts (P ╝ 0.013) and invasive
fronts (P ╝ 0.002) was associated with an advanced TNM stage
(Table I). Loss of claudin-4 expression was correlated with poor tumor
differentiation (central part, P ╝ 0.011; invasive front, P ╝ 0.022) and
advanced TNM stage (central part, P ╝ 0.011; invasive front, P ╝
0.008; Table II). Similarly, reduced expression of E-cadherin (central
part, P < 0.001; invasive front, P ╝ 0.012; Table III) and of membra-
nous b-catenin (central part, P ╝ 0.002; invasive front, P ╝ 0.004) was
associated with poor tumor differentiation. No signi?cant relationship
was found between nuclear b-catenin expression and clinicopatholog-
ical variables (Table IV).

Survival

In the univariate analysis, poor tumor differentiation (P < 0.001), an
advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001), and loss of claudin-1 (central parts,
P ╝ 0.006;
invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.002), claudin-4 (central parts,
P < 0.001; invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.008), E-cadherin (central parts,
not signi?cant; invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.002), and membranous b-catenin

(central parts, P ╝ 0.035; invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.040) all signi?cantly
increased the likelihood of a poor cancer-related survival (Table V).
Regarding disease-free survival, poor tumor differentiation (P ╝
0.003), an advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001) as well as loss of clau-
din-1 (central parts, P ╝ 0.002; invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.001), claudin-4
(central parts, P ╝ 0.001; invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.016), E-cadherin
invasive fronts, P ╝ 0.003), and

DISCUSSION

In the present study, reduced expression of claudin-1 and -4 was
correlated with poor tumor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, and
poor prognosis. In support of our data, reduced claudin-1 expression was

earlier reported in stage II colon cancer with recurrence and poor
survival [10]. Similar to claudin-1, reduced expression of claudin-4
at invasive fronts was shown to be signi?cantly linked with poor tumor
differentiation, deeper invasion, in?ltrating growth pattern, lymphovas-
cular invasion, and metastasis [12]. In addition, low-mRNA levels of
claudin-1 were reported to be associated with poor tumor differentiation
[14].

Our observations con?rmed that in some of the cases studied claudin-
1 and -4 were anomalously higher in small area of the tumor than in the

normal mucosa. However, their overexpressions were not signi?cantly
associated with any clinicopathological variables or prognosis (data not
shown). Other researchers have described that claudin-1 or -4 proteins
and mRNA levels were upregulated in colon cancer [11,13û15,18]. In
vitro, overexpression of claudin-1 and -4 speci?cally stimulates invasive
activity of colon cancer cells with activation of matrix metalloprotei-
nases [11,19]. Since such claudins are crucial components of tight
junctions, alteration in their expression may affect cell proliferation,
motility, and invasiveness in cancer cells in vitro, and in vivo loss of their

expression contributes to a poorly differentiated phenotype as well as
disease progression.

In the current study, reduced expression or loss of E-cadherin and
membranous b-catenin at invasive fronts were associated with poor
tumor differentiation and proved to be independent adverse prognostic
factors on multivariate regression analysis, consistent with previous
studies of a large number of colorectal carcinoma cases [4,6,20].
Signi?cant relationships have also been described between loss of E-
cadherin expression and poorly differentiated tumors [1,3] and meta-
stasis [4]. In contrast, there was no apparent association between loss of
E-cadherin expression and tumor grade, DukesÆ stage, and prognosis in
other studies [2,20]. The discrepancies might be explained by differ-
ences in methodology or antibodies used.

Nuclear translocation of b-catenin is a hallmark feature of Wnt
signaling. In this setting, b-catenin translocates to the nucleus where
it forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with T-cell-speci?c tran-
scription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Tcf/Lef 1) to
activate downstream targets [21]. In addition, b-catenin/Tcf/Lef 1
signaling is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying clau-
din-1 or E-cadherin-dependent changes [18,22]. We have con?rmed
signi?cant positive associations between each immunoreactivity except
nuclear b-catenin, suggesting that Wnt signaling partially occurs in a
claudin/cadherin-independent fashion.

Previous immunohistochemical studies of b-catenin in colorectal
cancers have shown contradictory results with respect to nuclear stain-
ing and clinical outcome. In some cases, nuclear b-catenin staining was
predictive of worse survival [2,20], but others did not produce any
supportive evidence [5,23,24], in line with the present investigation.
Differences in results are probably due to case numbers, variation in
antigen retrieval and staining procedures and evaluation systems.

Cluster analysis have identi?ed three different patterns of immunor-
eactivity allowing good, intermediate, and poor prognostic groups to be
distinguished with differing phenotypes and independent survival out-
comes by multivariate regression analysis. The integrated analysis of
immunohistochemical markers with separate evaluation of particular
tumor parts facilitated more discriminatory identi?cation of prognostic
groups. These results raise the possibility that speci?c marker pro?les
