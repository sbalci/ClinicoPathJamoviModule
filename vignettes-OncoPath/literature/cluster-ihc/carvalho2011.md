Cluster analysis of immunohistochemical pro?les delineates CK7, vimentin, S100A1 and
C-kit (CD117) as an optimal panel in the differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma from
its mimics

Aims: To develop an immunohistochemical strategy for
distinguishing renal oncocytoma (RO) from the eosin-
ophilic variant of chromophobe (ChRCC), and papillary
(PRCC) and clear cell (CRCC) renal cell carcinoma
containing eosinophilic cytoplasm in core biopsy spec-
imens.
Methods and results: Cluster analysis was performed on
immunohistochemical data from 21 RO, 16 ChRCC, 16
CRCC and 20 PRCC patients. A panel of CK7, C-kit,
S100A1 and vimentin clustered into four groups.
Cluster A (94% ChRCC) expressed C-kit and CK7 and
lacked S100A1 and vimentin. Cluster B (95% RO)
expressed C-kit, S100A1, focal CK7 (single or small
clusters of cells) and lacked vimentin. Cluster C

comprised a mixture of PRCC and CRCC with no
expression of C-kit or CK7 and variable S100A1 and
vimentin. PRCC with strong expression of CK7 clus-
tered into group D. A panel of S100A1 (positive) and
focal CK7 expression distinguished RO from ChRCC
with 91% sensitivity and 93% speci?city. A panel of
vimentin (negative) and C-kit (positive) distinguished
RO from CRCC with 83% sensitivity and 86% speci?city
and RO from PRCC with 79% sensitivity and 88%
speci?city.
Conclusions: Hierarchical cluster analysis is an effective
approach to analyse high-volume immunohistochem-
ical data to generate an optimal panel in the differential
diagnosis of oncocytoma from its mimics.

plasm.1,2 Distinction of
these tumours, speci?cally
differentiation of benign oncocytoma from other
tumours with malignant potential is critical. Due to
imaging techniques, an
increasing utilization of
increasing number of small
indeterminate tumours
are being discovered radiologically and biopsied percu-
taneously.3 As these entities have varying clinical

170 J C Carvalho et al.

behaviour and implications, accurate diagnosis is
crucial to proper patient management, especially as a
subset of tumours can be treated conservatively by
minimally invasive techniques.

While architectural and cytological features can be
suf?cient to differentiate these tumours, there are often
overlapping morphological features, variable histolog-
features in different areas of the tumour and ?
ical
or the morphological criteria are not suf?cient
to
completely classify the tumour in a limited biopsy
specimen.3,4
Immunohistochemical markers have
been increasingly utilized to aid in the morphological
assessment and differential diagnosis of eosinophilic
renal
tumours with overlapping features, as other
studies including colloidal iron are technically dif?cult
and imprecise.5 Ancillary techniques such as ?uores-
cence in situ hybridization (FISH) have also been
studied; however, it is technically intensive, not widely
available and less reliable, speci?cally in the differen-
tial diagnosis of renal oncocytoma from its closest
mimic, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, due to lack
of speci?c cytogenetic abnormalities.6 While a number
of antibodies have been touted as useful
for these
tumour types they often show overlapping immuno-
reactivity patterns, making selection of an optimal
panel useful in day-to-day practice a challenge for the
surgical pathologist. The antibodies, which have been
studied in this differential diagnosis either individually
or as a variable panel, include CK7, C-kit (CD117),
vimentin, progesterone receptor, E-cadherin, kidney-
speci?c cadherin, S100A1, MOC31, epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM), parvalbumin, CD10,
caveolin 1, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), Pax-2,
AMACR, claudin-7 and claudin-8.7û20 However, none
of the proposed markers is highly sensitive or speci?c
to the diagnosis of these entities and therefore a panel
approach is usually recommended to resolve the
diagnosis.

Hierarchical cluster tree analysis, a powerful math-
ematical
tool most often used for analysing gene
expression data, has been shown to be similarly
valuable to discover discriminating patterns and trends
from high-volume immunohistochemical data.21 The
aim of our study was to further characterize the
immunohistochemical pro?les of oncocytoma and its
close mimics in a model that mimics small biopsy
sampling. For this objective, we evaluated a series of 73
renal tumours containing eosinophilic cytoplasm in
tissue microarrays with a select panel of 14 traditional
and novel immunohistochemical markers proposed to
be useful in the differential diagnosis of oncocytoma
from its mimics to identify an optimal panel of markers
that can be applied in day-to-day clinical practice.

Materials and methods
case select ion

After approval from the University of Michigan Insti-
tutional Review Board for human subject research,
tumours were identi?ed via a snomed search of the
pathology database. A total of 73 renal tumours with
eosinophilic cytoplasm, comprising 21 oncocytomas,
16 eosinophilic variant of chromophobe RCCs, 16 clear
cell RCCs with predominant eosinophilic ? granular
cytoplasm and 20 papillary RCCs containing variable
eosinophilic or oncocytic cytoplasm were selected,
otherwise based randomly on available tumour vol-
ume. All cases included were resection specimens
(radical or partial nephrectomy) and all haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were reviewed by
study pathologists (JC, MW, RBS) and the histological
types were determined according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) 2004 classi?cation.1 For cases in
which the diagnosis could not be determined on the
histology alone, several immunohistochemical markers
were utilized and the ?nal diagnosis was reached based
on a combination of morphologic features on H&E and
a panel of immunohistochemical markers.

A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from 0.6-
mm cores of formalin-?xed, paraf?n-embedded neoplas-
tic tissue in triplicate as well as representative normal
kidney sections from the same cases for controls. The
TMA slides were stained with a select panel of 14
antibodies, using standard immunohistochemical tech-
niques on an automated Ventana Benchmark XT stainer
(Ventana, Phoenix, AZ, USA) or a Dako AutoStainer
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The list of antibodies, their
origins, titration with pretreatments, incubation times
and expected staining characteristics are listed in
Table 1. The expression of each antibody was charac-
terized on a 0û2 scale, where 0 represented 0û<10% of
cell staining, 1 represented 10û<50% of cell staining
and ? or weak staining intensity and two represented
>50% of cell staining and ? or intense immunoreactivity.
Intensity data expressed as plain scores (0, 1, 2) were
arranged in a text delimited ?le and broadcasted from the
Data Matrix Viewer (DMV) module of the gaggle software
suite (http://gaggle.systembiology.net/docs) to the Mul-
ti-Experiment viewer of the tm4 software suite (http://
www.tm4.org/mev.html). Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering was performed using average linkage analysis
with Euclidean distance metric and the data were divided

at the third branch point down in the cluster tree. Given
the broad panel of antibodies that were analysed, several
markers were found to have overlapping staining
patterns or were found to have minimal discriminating
properties among the different tumour types. After
removal of the antibodies with overlapping staining
results, a limited re?ned panel of markers was included in
a ?nal unsupervised cluster analysis. From this cluster
plot, the speci?city and sensitivity of selected markers was
calculated for each tumour type. The positive predictive
values of the panel of markers that were included in the
analysis were determined for each tumour type.

Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
All the ChRCC tumours demonstrated mainly intense
diffuse reactivity for C-kit, E-cadherin and parvalbumin
(16 of 16, 100%). Several other markers that were
highly sensitive included EpCAM, MOC-31 and clau-
din-7, which were positive in 94% (15 of 16) of cases
each. Diffuse reactivity with CK7 was present in 81%
(13 of 16) of the tumours, with only one tumour (6%)
showing focal intense positivity while no expression
was seen in two cases (13%). Only one case (6%)
expressed S100A1 and Pax-2. In this cohort, lack of
immunoreactivity with both Pax-2 and S100A1 was
the major discriminating feature of ChRCC from RO,
PRCC and CRCC. All these tumours were uniformly
non-immunoreactive to RCC and ? or vimentin.

Renal oncocytoma
Nearly all RO were positive for C-kit, E-cadherin and
parvalbumin (95%, 20 of 21). In addition, S100A1
was expressed diffusely and strongly in 95% (20 of 21)

of tumours. No diffuse reactivity for CK7 was identi?ed
in RO tumours; however, focal cytoplasmic ? membra-
nous reactivity for CK7 characterized by single cells or
small clusters of cells was observed in 95% of RO,
making this particular staining pattern highly sensitive
for these tumours. Compared to ChRCC, RO expressed
EpCAM, MOC-31 and claudin-7 in 33û50% of cases.
Surprisingly, Pax-2 was the most sensitive (76%, 16 of
21 cases) for RO among the different tumour types.
Similar to ChRCC, RO cases lacked expression for RCC,
and except for a single case (5%) all lacked vimentin.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
Most of
the immunohistochemical markers in our
panel were insensitive for CRCC tumours. The antibod-
ies with the greatest sensitivities were CD10, Alpha-
methylacyl-CoA-Racemase (AMACR), S100A1 and
vimentin, with sensitivities ranging from 94% to
75%, respectively. Approximately half of CRCC tu-
mours (44û50%) were positive for parvalbumin, RCC,
CAIX and Pax-2. A smaller fraction (31%, ?ve of 16) of
CRCC expressed E-cadherin and most tumours did not
express CK7, EpCAM, MOC-31, claudin-7 and C-kit.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma
The most sensitive marker of PRCC in our panel of
antibodies was AMACR, which was expressed diffusely
and strongly in 100% of tumours. Although parval-
bumin expression was seen in 90% (18 of 20) of PRCC
tumours, most cases demonstrated weak positivity.
Similar to CRCC, approximately 85% of PRCC were
positive for CD10, vimentin or S100A1. RCC was the
most sensitive marker for PRCC among the four
tumour types, with 75% of tumours showing reactiv-
ity. Around half to two-thirds of all PRCC expressed
CK7, EpCAM, MOC-31, claudin-7 and Pax-2. CAIX and
E-cadherin expression was restricted to just over a third
of cases. Like CRCC, PRCC tumours did not demon-
strate staining with C-kit.

c l u s t e r an a l y s i s

An initial unsupervised cluster plot of the extended
panel of 14 antibodies clustered into four groups based
on staining similarities and is shown in Figure 1.
Group A is composed of nearly all the ChRCC (94%, 15
of 16) tumours and almost half the RO (43%, nine of
21) with both tumour types demonstrating expression
of EpCAM, MOC-31, claudin-7, parvalbumin, C-kit and
E-cadherin, with a greater intensity of C-kit and E-
cadherin identi?ed in ChRCC. The two PRCC tumours
that segregated into group A were included because of
intense staining for CK7, EpCAM, MOC-31, claudin-7,

Figure 1. Initial unsupervised cluster map of expanded immunohistochemical panel for four categories of renal epithelial neoplasms with
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Antibodies are arrayed at the top of the map and the four types of tumours are listed along the right side. The red line on
the left is the level of the clustering tree that separates the tumours into four groups. Group A illustrates the similar immunohistochemical
pro?les of both renal oncocytoma (RO) and eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) when using an extended panel of
markers. The remaining RO tumours which did not express EpCAM, MOC-31 and claudin-7 are clustered in group B. Group C is composed of a
mix of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), which highlights their overlapping immunohisto-
chemical features. Finally, group D is populated entirely by a subset of PRCC which nearly all express intense CK7 compared to PRCC in group C.

E-cadherin and a lack of CD10 and RCC. The remaining
RO (57%, 12 of 21) were grouped into group B and
differed from the RO in group A because of the lack of
reactivity with EpCAM, MOC-31 and claudin-7. A
single ChRCC that did not express CK7, EpCAM, MOC-
31 and claudin-7, as did the group A ChRCC tumours,

was classi?ed into group B. In addition, the only CRCC
which expressed C-kit, a marker that is exclusive to RO
and ChRCC in our cluster analysis, was segregated to
cluster B. The absence of C-kit and CK7 reactivity and
strong expression of CD10 characterized group C,
which was comprised of a mix of 60% CRCC and

40% PRCC. Finally, group D was restricted primarily to
those PRCC mainly expressing intense CK7.

Several overlapping expression patterns were delin-
eated by the initial unsupervised cluster analysis of the
panel of antibodies examined. EpCAM, MOC-31 and
claudin-7 clustered together, as all three antibodies had
essentially similar percentages of positivity among the
four tumour types (see Table 2). Other antibodies that
clustered together to a signi?cant but lesser degree
included the following pairs: C-kit and E-cadherin,
CD10 and AMACR, RCC and vimentin, and S100A1
and Pax-2.

The initial unsupervised cluster plot (Figure 2) along

reviewed and antibodies with
signi?cant overlap between the four types of renal
tumours were removed. An unsupervised cluster anal-
ysis with a select and limited panel that included CK7,
C-kit, S100A1 and vimentin was performed (see
Figure 3). The cluster plot of the select antibody panel
separated all the cases into four distinct groups at the
second division point of the cluster tree. All ChRCC
were segregated into group A, characterized by expres-
sion of C-kit and diffuse expression of CK7 along with a
lack of both S100A1 and vimentin. One case of RO fell
into this cluster due to a lack of expression for S100A1.
Group B was populated by 90% (19 of 21) of the RO
based on the expression of C-kit and S100A1, with
most tumours showing focal CK7 expression and a lack
of vimentin. One CRCC tumour that expressed C-kit
and clustered into group B in the initial unsupervised
analysis also fell into group B. Half of PRCC and 94%
(15 of 16) of CRCC tumours comprised group C, along
with the only RO case, which lacked C-kit. All tumours
in group C lacked C-kit, most of the tumours (81%)
expressed S100A1 and vimentin, and only one PRCC
expressed CK7 weakly. Finally, group D was restricted
to PRCC that predominantly display intense CK7,
which is similar to the initial unsupervised cluster,
but included three additional PRCC tumours.

prise an optimal panel in the differential diagnosis of
four categories of renal epithelial tumours with eosin-
ophilic cytoplasm are presented in Table 3.

CK7 expression seen in single cells or clusters of cells
pattern in RO was found to be both sensitive and
speci?c (89% and 86%, respectively) in distinguishing
RO from ChRCC. Absent S100A1 reactivity in ChRCC
was able to exclude RO, which showed weak to strong

staining with a greater sensitivity of 94% and speci?c-
ity of 95%. Used in conjunction, separating RO and
ChRCC with both CK7 and S100A1 was found to have
a sensitivity and speci?city of 91% and 93%, respec-
tively. The ability to differentiate RO from both PRCC
and CRCC with positive C-kit and negative vimentin
expression demonstrated similar sensitivities and spec-
i?cities ranging from 79% to 83% and 88% to 86%,
respectively. S100A1 was able to distinguish ChRCC
from both PRCC and CRCC with sensitivity of 83% and
speci?city of 93û94%. The lack of S100A1 expression
in ChRCC compared to RO, CRCC and PRCC demon-
strated the highest speci?city at 98% but was the least
sensitive, with a sensitivity of only 68%.

Utilizing the panel of select antibodies based on our
cluster analysis, the positive predictive value (PPV) for
the diagnosis of RO with an immunopro?le of
CK7(focal+ ? )), S100A1(+), C-kit(+) and vimentin())
is 86%. For ChRCC, the expression of diffuse CK7(+),
S100A1()), C-kit(+) and vimentin()) has a PPV of
81%. The staining pattern of S100A1(+), CK7-kit()),
vimentin (+) and CK7()) in CRCC or CK(+ ? )) in
papillary has a PPV for CRCC and PRCC of 69% and
70%, respectively. This panel was not able to distin-
guish between CRCC and PRCC conclusively.

Discussion

immunohistochemical markers in the
The utility of
differential diagnosis of oncocytoma from its close
mimics, especially the eosinophilic variant of ChRCC,
has been a matter of intense investigation with many
novel markers proposed, often with variable sensitivity
and speci?city. The goal of this study was to examine
many of the previously studied antibodies and develop
a panel of markers based on immunopro?les that can
distinguish oncocytoma from its close mimics in a
model similar to small biopsy sampling. Our approach
of cluster tree analysis to high-volume immunohisto-
chemical data effectively demonstrates many of the
proposed markers have signi?cant overlapping immuno-
histochemical patterns in the different renal tumour
types and hence are of
limited utility in day-to-day
practice. Initial unsupervised analysis highlighted that
most of the markers are not effective in distinguishing
the four tumour types, except for CK7, C-kit, vimentin
and S100A1, which de?ned our optimal panel (see
Figures 2 and 3). Our results show that using a broad
panel as seen in the initial unsupervised analysis
incurred overlap between ChRCC and a subset of RO,
which was due to focal ? weak expression of EpCAM,
MOC-31 and claudin-7 seen in the segregated RO. These
markers, along with E-cadherin, parvalbumin, CD10

in our select panel. Recently, Gupta et al.9 examined
CAIX in renal epithelial neoplasms and found CAIX
to be helpful
in differentiating between CRCC and
ChRCC, as expression of CAIX was present only in
CRCC. In our study, CAIX reactivity was identi?ed in
up to 30% of ChRCC and only 50% of CRCC.
Interestingly, Skapa et al.27 noted recently that the
amount and intensity of reactivity of CAIX in CRCC
was related to the proportion of cells with granular
cytoplasm, which may explain the lower percentage of
CRCC that expressed CAIX in our study. In addition,
the reactivity of CAIX in ChRCC was primarily weak in
nature. In several studies, Pax-2 has been shown to be
able to distinguish between RO and ChRCC, with RO
immunoreactivity ranging from 87% to 100% com-
pared to ChRCC with 6û9%.9,13,28 In a recent study by
Ozcan et al.,29 it was discovered that Pax-2 expression
was present in 83% of ChRCC and 88% of RO. Our

results with Pax-2 in distinguishing RO from ChRCC
are more consistent with earlier studies, and we found
Pax-2 to have potentially signi?cant utility in this
important differential diagnosis. In our study, only a
single case of ChRCC (6%) was positive with Pax-2
compared to 76% of RO. The expression of Pax-2 in
CRCC is lower in our cohort (50%) compared to a
study by Gupta et al.9 (93%) and, hence,
in our
experience Pax-2 has limited utility in distinguishing
CRCC from ChRCC. Expression of Pax-2 in PRCC (65%)
is comparable to other published studies. Finally, in our
study, AMACR has been shown to be strongly and
diffusely positive in nearly all PRCC, while the majority
of RO and ChRCC are negative. Overall, our results
mirror previous studies,19,30 which have also shown
that 11û15% of RO and 0û16% of ChRCC show
expression of AMACR; however, we found that up to
81% of CRCC were strongly positive with AMACR

Reviewing the initial unsupervised cluster analysis
identi?ed markers with overlapping staining patterns
that were not helpful in differentiating between the four
types of oncocytic renal epithelial tumours, and hence
a second unsupervised cluster analysis was performed
using CK7, C-kit, vimentin and S100A1.
In our
experience, both S100A1 and ? or Pax-2 are useful in
distinguishing RO from ChRCC.

S100A1 is a member of the S100 family of calcium-
binding proteins genes, most of which are clustered on
chromosome 1q21, that has been found to be expressed
in renal cell carcinomas.32 Using reverse transcriptionû
polymerase chain reaction (RTûPCR), the expression of
S100A1 mRNA have been found in several studies to
be elevated in PRCC and RO and decreased signi?cantly
in ChRCC; however, wide variation in the level of
expression has been found in CRCC. Both Rocca and Li
et al. have demonstrated correlation between the
molecular and immunohistochemical expression of
S100A1.11,16 In comparing the recent studies exam-
ining immunohistochemical expression of S100A1 in
renal neoplasms, CRCC has been found to be expressed
in 66û73% of cases and 67û94% of PRCC.11,16 The
highest level of expression has been identi?ed in RO,
with 92û93% of cases demonstrating reactivity with
S100A1 compared to 0û6% of ChRCC, which have
been found to be negative.11,16,22

We found the lack of S100A1 in ChRCC to be both
sensitive and speci?c compared to RO. Our results are
similar to previous studies that found RO to be positive
for S100A1 in 92û93% of cases versus 0û6% of ChRCC

(cid:2) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Histopathology, 58, 169û179.

tumours.11,16,22 Among CRCC and PRCC, our results
(81% and 85%, respectively) are comparable with Rocca
et al., who studied 41 CRCC and 32 PRCC and found
that 73% of CRCC and 94% of PRCC were positive, with
S100A1 supporting that the lack of S100A1 in a renal
tumour with granular cytoplasm is speci?c for ChRCC.
Although both Pax-2 and S100A1 are expressed
similarly in ChRCC and have similar utility in distin-
guishing RO from ChRCC, our data show that S100A1
is superior to Pax-2 (95% expression in RO compared
to 76% expression in RO by Pax-2). In addition, lack of
S100A1 is also superior in discriminating ChRCC from
CRCC and PRCC in comparison to Pax-2, and hence
justi?es the inclusion of S100A1 versus Pax-2 in our
select panel.

The second marker in our panel that was helpful in
differentiating between RO and ChRCC was CK7. The
majority (90%) of RO demonstrated single cells or
clusters of cells with CK 7 immunoreactivity (see
Figure 3) compared to diffuse CK7 immunoreactivity
observed in ChRCC. Two cases demonstrated complete
lack of staining and no case demonstrated diffuse CK 7
expression. Therefore, a staining pattern of single cells
or clusters of cells with CK7 is a distinct pattern that
can aid in the identi?cation of RO. Although many
studies have examined the role of CK7 in the differen-
tial between RO and CRCC, our results fall within the
range of many studies that have found diffuse reactivity
for CK7 in 0û10% of RO and 73û100% of
ChRCC.7,13,14,17,21û23,28,33,34 Both C-kit and vimentin
were found to be helpful
in distinguishing RO and
ChRCC from CRCC and PRCC. C-kit has been found
previously to be positive in RO and ChRCC in 71û100%

178 J C Carvalho et al.

of cases with up to 5% of CRCC and PRCC demon-
strating focal expression.10,15,18,23,28,35 Interestingly,
the only case of CRCC that was positive for C-kit in our
study showed intense reactivity and had many other
immunohistochemical features of a RO, and hence, not
surprisingly, segregated with the RO cluster. However,
re-review of multiple sections of the tumour con?rmed
the last antibody
the diagnosis of CRCC. Finally,
included in our optimal panel of markers was vimentin,
which was found to be helpful in distinguishing RO and
ChRCC from CRCC and PRCC (positive in most PRCC
and CRCC tumours and negative in all but one RO that
demonstrated weak focal reactivity). As no single
marker has been discovered that is uniquely speci?c
and sensitive in the discriminating renal epithelial
tumours with eosinophilic cytoplasm, a panel of
antibodies is needed in the differential which in our
analysis has found these four markers to have a
positive predictive value for RO and ChRCC of 86%
and 81%, respectively. In our cohort, and similar to
a previous study, unsupervised cluster analysis was
not able to differentiate suf?ciently between PRCC and
CRCC with eosinophilic cytoplasm.14 In addition, the
PPVs of our panel of markers were lower for PRCC and
CRCC compared to the PPVs for RO and ChRCC.

By utilizing such an approach on a broad panel of 14
traditional and many novel markers, we advocate that
a panel of CK7, S100A1, C-kit and vimentin is optimal
in the differential diagnosis of oncocytoma from its
close mimics.
