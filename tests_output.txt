=== Test 1: Default Spider Plot with Response Coloring ===
Default spider plot with response coloring passed successfully!

=== Test 2: Spider Plot with Group Coloring by Treatment Arm ===
Spider plot with treatment arm group coloring passed successfully!

=== Test 3: Spider Plot with Group Coloring by Disease Stage ===
Spider plot with disease stage group coloring passed successfully!

=== Test 4: Backward Compatibility Test (No spider options specified) ===
Backward compatibility test passed - defaults work correctly!

=== Test 5: Spider Plot with Percentage Data ===
Note: Spider plot with percentage data shows static values over time. Consider using raw measurements for meaningful trajectories.
Spider plot with percentage data and group coloring passed successfully!

=== Test Summary ===
Spider plot group coloring feature successfully implemented!
Features tested:
1. Default response-based coloring (backward compatible)
2. Group-based coloring by treatment arm
3. Group-based coloring by disease stage
4. Multiple color schemes (classic, jamovi, colorful)
5. Works with both raw and percentage data

Users can now:
- Set 'Spider Plot Color By' to 'Patient Groups' for group-based coloring
- Choose color schemes optimized for different group counts
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing analyses

welcome_message: Testing advancedraincloud welcome message functionality...

=== Test 1: No variables selected (should show welcome) ===
Testing scenario: NULL variables 
  -> Should display welcome message without errors
Testing scenario: Empty string variables 
  -> Should display welcome message without errors
Testing scenario: Zero length variables 
  -> Should display welcome message without errors

=== Test 2: Variables selected (should proceed to analysis) ===
Testing with actual data and variables:
  -> Should proceed past welcome message to analysis

Fix Summary:
1. .init() now skips validation when no data is present
2. .run() has robust variable checking (null, empty, zero-length)
3. Welcome message should appear immediately without loading spinner
4. No more initialization errors preventing todo display

  T2   0 161  19   0
  T3   0   3 144   2
  T4   0   0   0  73


=== TEST 2: Will Rogers Phenomenon Conditions ===

Stage T2 :
  Original system: n = 180 , median survival = 29.8 months
  New system: n = 164 , median survival = 31.3 months
  Improvement: 1.6 months (IMPROVED) 

Stage T3 :
  Original system: n = 149 , median survival = 21.7 months
  New system: n = 163 , median survival = 21 months
  Improvement: -0.7 months (WORSENED) 

Stage T4 :
  Original system: n = 73 , median survival = 18.2 months
  New system: n = 75 , median survival = 18.2 months
  Improvement: 0 months (WORSENED) 


=== TEST 3: Expected Feature Outputs ===

3.1 Will Rogers Visualization:
- Should show bar chart comparing median survival
- Should identify T2→T3 as dominant migration pattern
- Should show survival changes for both T2 and T3

3.2 Migration Survival Curves:
- Should display faceted KM curves for T2 and T3
- Red curves (before) vs Blue curves (after)
- Sample sizes should be displayed

3.3 Enhanced Statistical Analysis:

Attaching package: 'survival'

The following objects are masked from 'package:ClinicoPath':

    colon, finegray


T2 (original) analysis:
- With migrated patients: n = 180 , median = 44.2 
- Without migrated patients: n = 161 , median = 44.2 
- Expected p-value from log-rank test


=== TEST 4: Error Handling ===

4.1 No migration scenario:
- Should show 'No stage migration detected' message
- All features should handle gracefully

4.2 Small sample size (n=20):
- Should show 'Insufficient data' messages where appropriate
- Should not crash


=== TEST 5: Integration Checklist ===

Enable these options in jamovi:
[ ] Advanced Migration Analysis
