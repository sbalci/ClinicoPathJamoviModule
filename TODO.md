# ClinicoPath Development Roadmap - Remaining Features

## Overview

This document contains only the **REMAINING** features to be implemented in the ClinicoPath jamovi module. All completed features have been documented in `/vignettes/ClinicoPath-ImplementedFeatures-2025.qmd`.


**ðŸ“… REMAINING FEATURES:**

Advanced Bayesian methods, robust statistical methods, specialized survival analysis

## Remaining High-Priority Features

- **Robust regression methods:** Resistant to outliers and influential observations
- **Non-parametric alternatives:** Distribution-free statistical methods

### Advanced Survival Analysis Remaining Items

**Specialized Survival Methods (Selected Remaining Items):**

- âœ… **Excess mortality modeling** (`mexhaz`) - Population-based excess mortality analysis - **COMPLETED**
- âœ… **Flexible relative survival** (`flexrsurv`) - Relative survival with spline smoothing - **COMPLETED**  
- âœ… **Interval-censored cure models** (`ICGOR`) - Cure models for interval-censored data - **COMPLETED**
- âœ… **Threshold regression** (`threg`) - Change-point survival modeling - **COMPLETED**

**Advanced High-Dimensional Methods (Selected Remaining Items):**

- **Penalized Cox regression** (`penalized`) - L1/L2 penalized survival models
- **Spatial Bayesian survival** (`spBayesSurv`) - Geographic survival modeling
