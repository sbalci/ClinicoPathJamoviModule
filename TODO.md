BrawStats Jamovi Module Evaluation

  Analysis Summary

  BrawStats is a statistical education-focused jamovi module that employs HTML/JavaScript for enhanced UI functionality. Here's my evaluation:

  Architecture Findings

  BrawStats Structure:

- Standard jamovi 4-file pattern (.a.yaml, .u.yaml, .r.yaml, .b.R)
- Key Innovation: JavaScript events file (jamovi/js/brawsim.events.js)
- HTML content files for educational materials
- Complex educational workflow with guided demos

  JavaScript Integration:

- 1,147-line events file with sophisticated UI state management
- Real-time parameter validation and interdependent control updates
- Dynamic preset systems for educational scenarios
- Complex event chains for guided learning experiences

  Reusable UI Patterns

  1. Dynamic Parameter Validation
  onChange_effectSize: function() {
    let rIV = ui.EffectSize1.value()
    let rIV2 = ui.EffectSize2.value()
    // Auto-corrects mathematically invalid combinations
    let fullES = rIV^2+rIV2^2+2*rIV*rIV2*rIVIV2+rIVIV2DV^2
    if (fullES>=1) {
      // Automatically scales down to valid range
      while (fullES>=1) {
        rIV = rIV*0.9
        // Updates UI controls
        ui.EffectSize1.setValue(rIV)
      }
    }
  }

  Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Proof of Concept
  // Example for diagnostic calculator
  onChange_prevalence: function() {
    let prev = ui.prevalence.value()
    if (prev < 0.001 || prev > 0.999) {
      ui.prevalence.setValue(Math.max(0.001, Math.min(0.999, prev)))
    }
    this.updatePPV()
