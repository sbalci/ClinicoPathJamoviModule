# Introduction

Person-time analysis is a fundamental concept in epidemiology and survival analysis that accounts for the varying observation periods of study participants. The jsurvival module in ClinicoPath provides comprehensive person-time calculations and incidence rate analysis across its survival analysis functions.

## What is Person-Time?

**Person-time** represents the total observation time contributed by all participants in a study while being at risk for the event of interest. Unlike simple participant counts, person-time captures both the number of subjects and their observation duration, providing accurate denominators for rate calculations.

### Key Concepts

- **Total Person-Time**: Sum of all individual follow-up periods
- **Incidence Rate**: Number of events ÷ Total person-time  
- **Time Units**: Typically expressed as person-days, person-months, or person-years
- **Censoring**: Properly accounts for participants leaving the study early
- **Varying Follow-up**: Handles different observation periods for each participant

### Why Person-Time Matters

1. **Accurate Rate Calculations**: Provides proper denominators for incidence rates
2. **Comparison Across Studies**: Enables valid comparisons between populations with different follow-up patterns
3. **Adjustment for Time**: Accounts for varying exposure periods in survival analysis
4. **Kaplan-Meier Foundation**: Forms the basis for survival curve estimation
5. **Cox Model Integration**: Essential for hazard ratio calculations

# Getting Started with Person-Time Analysis

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Your dataset should include:
- **Time variable**: Follow-up duration (numeric)
- **Event variable**: Event indicator (0/1 or factor)
- **Group variables**: For comparisons (optional)
- **Date variables**: For time calculation (optional)

Example data structure:
```
patient_id | followup_months | event | treatment_group | diagnosis_date | last_contact
PT0001     | 24.5           | 1     | Standard       | 2020-01-15     | 2022-01-30
PT0002     | 36.2           | 0     | Experimental   | 2020-02-10     | 2023-02-15
```

## Step 2: Choose the Appropriate Analysis

**Time Interval Calculator**: If you need to calculate follow-up times from dates
- Input: Start and end dates
- Output: Time intervals and person-time concepts

**Single Arm Survival**: For overall cohort analysis
- Input: Time, event variables
- Output: Overall incidence rates and time-stratified analysis

**Survival Analysis**: For group comparisons
- Input: Time, event, grouping variables
- Output: Group-specific rates and comparisons

**Multivariable Survival**: For adjusted analysis
- Input: Time, event, multiple covariates
- Output: Adjusted rates and Cox model integration

## Step 3: Configure Person-Time Options

1. **Enable person-time analysis**: Check "Calculate Person-Time Metrics"
2. **Set time intervals**: Specify intervals for stratified analysis (e.g., "12, 36, 60")
3. **Choose rate multiplier**: Select 100 or 1000 for rate presentation
4. **Configure time units**: Ensure consistent units throughout

## Step 4: Interpret Results

### Person-Time Table Columns

- **Time Interval**: Period analyzed (e.g., 0-12 months, 12-36 months)
- **Events**: Number of events in the interval
- **Person-Time**: Total observation time in the interval
- **Incidence Rate**: Events per person-time unit
- **95% CI**: Confidence interval for the rate (Poisson exact)

### Key Metrics to Report

1. **Total Person-Time**: Overall observation time
2. **Overall Incidence Rate**: Events per 100 person-time units
3. **Time-Specific Rates**: Rates in different follow-up periods
4. **Group Comparisons**: Rate differences between groups
5. **Confidence Intervals**: Precision of rate estimates

# Clinical Applications

## Example 1: Cancer Survival Study

Rate Ratio: 0.77 (23% reduction in death rate)
```

## Example 2: Epidemiological Cohort Study

Rate Difference: 0.89 per 100 person-years
Relative Risk: 2.03
```

## Example 3: Drug Safety Monitoring

0-6 months: 8 events in 600 person-months (1.33 per 100 person-months)
6+ months: 4 events in 900 person-months (0.44 per 100 person-months)
Conclusion: Higher event rate in early treatment period
```

# Advanced Features

## Time-Stratified Analysis

Person-time analysis can be stratified by time intervals to detect:
- Changing hazards over time
- Early vs. late event patterns
- Treatment effect modifications
- Time-dependent risk factors

**Setup**: Specify intervals in "Time Interval Stratification" option
```
Example: "6, 12, 24" creates intervals: 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, 24+ months
```

## Rate Multipliers

Choose appropriate multipliers based on event frequency:
- **Rate per 100 person-time**: Common for moderate event rates
- **Rate per 1000 person-time**: Useful for rare events
- **Rate per 10,000 person-time**: For very rare events

## Confidence Intervals

Person-time rates use Poisson exact confidence intervals:
- **Exact method**: Based on Poisson distribution of event counts
- **Conservative approach**: Provides accurate coverage
- **Asymmetric intervals**: Reflects the nature of count data

## Integration with Survival Analysis

Person-time analysis complements traditional survival methods:
- **Kaplan-Meier curves**: Show survival probability over time
- **Cox regression**: Models hazard rates (instantaneous person-time rates)
- **Log-rank tests**: Compare survival distributions
- **Person-time rates**: Provide absolute risk measures

# Quality Assurance

## Data Validation

Before person-time analysis:

1. **Check time variables**: Ensure positive, numeric values
2. **Validate event coding**: Confirm 0/1 or appropriate factor levels
3. **Review missingness**: Address missing time or event data
4. **Assess outliers**: Investigate extremely long or short follow-up times

## Results Interpretation

When reviewing person-time results:

1. **Biological plausibility**: Do rates make clinical sense?
2. **Confidence intervals**: Are they appropriately wide for the data?
3. **Time trends**: Do time-stratified rates show expected patterns?
4. **Group differences**: Are rate differences clinically meaningful?

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Zero Events in Intervals
**Problem**: Some time intervals have no events
**Solution**: Consider combining intervals or using exact Poisson methods

### Issue 2: Very Unequal Follow-up
**Problem**: Large variation in follow-up times
**Solution**: Use time-stratified analysis and report median follow-up

### Issue 3: Competing Risks
**Problem**: Multiple event types affecting person-time
**Solution**: Use competing risks analysis with event-specific person-time

# Reporting Person-Time Results

## Methods Section

```
Person-time analysis was performed to calculate incidence rates accounting 
for varying follow-up periods. Total person-time was calculated as the sum 
of individual follow-up periods from [entry criteria] to [endpoint definition]. 
Incidence rates were calculated as the number of events divided by person-time 
at risk, expressed per [time unit]. Confidence intervals were calculated using 
Poisson exact methods. Time-stratified analysis was performed using intervals 
of [specify intervals] to assess for time-varying hazards.
```

## Results Section

```
A total of [N] participants contributed [total person-time] [time units] of 
follow-up (median [median], range [range]). [Number] events occurred during 
the observation period, yielding an overall incidence rate of [rate] per 
[multiplier] [time units] (95% CI: [CI]). Incidence rates differed significantly 
between [groups]: [group 1] [rate 1] vs. [group 2] [rate 2] per [multiplier] 
[time units] (rate ratio [RR], 95% CI: [CI], p=[p-value]).
```
