## Introduction

Welcome to the ClinicoPathJamoviModule! This vignette will guide you through the basics of using the module to perform common analyses in clinicopathological research.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have:

*   **jamovi:** Download and install the latest version of jamovi from [https://www.jamovi.org/download.html](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html).
*   **ClinicoPathJamoviModule:** Install the module within jamovi. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Installation Guide in our Documentation Hub](../documentation_hub.md#installation-guide).

## Loading Data

Let's start by loading one of the example datasets that comes with the module. We'll use the `survival` dataset for this example.

In jamovi, you can open the `survival` dataset by going to the `File` menu, selecting `Open`, and then navigating to the `Data Library` and selecting `ClinicoPathJamoviModule` to find the example datasets. (Consider adding a screenshot here for visual guidance).

## Performing a Simple Analysis: Table One

One of the most common tasks in clinicopathological research is to create a "Table One" that summarizes the baseline characteristics of the study population. Let's create a Table One using the `gtsummary` function.

1.  Go to the `Analyses` tab in jamovi.
2.  Under the `Exploration` menu, select `gtsummary`.
3.  Drag the variables you want to summarize into the `Variables` box.
4.  Optionally, you can select a grouping variable in the `Group by` box to create a comparative table.

## Performing a Survival Analysis

Now, let's perform a simple survival analysis using the `survival` function.

1.  Go to the `Analyses` tab in jamovi.
2.  Under the `Survival` menu, select `Survival`.
3.  Select the `Time Elapsed` variable.
4.  Select the `Outcome` variable and the `Event Level`.
5.  Select the `Explanatory Variable` to compare survival between groups.

This will generate a Kaplan-Meier plot and a table with survival statistics.

## Interpreting the Results

The output of the analysis will be displayed in the results panel in jamovi. The tables and plots are designed to be publication-ready and easy to interpret.

For more detailed information on how to interpret the results of a specific analysis, please refer to the documentation for that analysis.
