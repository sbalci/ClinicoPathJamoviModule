## Vignette 1: ROC Analysis with `psychopdaroc`

### Introduction

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis is fundamental in evaluating diagnostic tests. The `psychopdaroc` function provides comprehensive ROC analysis with multiple methods for determining optimal cutpoints.

### Basic Usage

```r
library(meddecide)

# Load example data
data(cancer_biomarker)  # Hypothetical dataset

# Basic ROC analysis
roc_result <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",           # Test variable
  classVar = "cancer_status",      # Binary outcome (0/1)
  positiveClass = "1"              # Which level is positive
)
```

### Understanding ROC Curves

An ROC curve plots sensitivity (true positive rate) against 1-specificity (false positive rate) across all possible cutpoints. The area under the curve (AUC) summarizes overall diagnostic accuracy:

- AUC = 0.5: No discrimination (diagonal line)
- AUC = 0.7-0.8: Acceptable discrimination
- AUC = 0.8-0.9: Excellent discrimination
- AUC > 0.9: Outstanding discrimination

### Optimal Cutpoint Methods

The package offers several methods to determine optimal cutpoints:

```r
# Method 1: Maximize Youden's Index (default)
roc_youden <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  method = "maximize_metric",
  metric = "youden"  # Sensitivity + Specificity - 1
)

# Method 2: Cost-benefit optimization
roc_cost <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  method = "oc_cost_ratio",
  costratioFP = 2.5  # False positives cost 2.5x more than false negatives
)

# Method 3: Equal sensitivity and specificity
roc_equal <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  method = "oc_equal_sens_spec"
)
```

### Comparing Multiple Tests

```r
# Compare multiple biomarkers
roc_comparison <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = c("PSA", "CA125", "CEA"),  # Multiple tests
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  combinePlots = TRUE,        # Show all curves in one plot
  delongTest = TRUE           # Statistical comparison of AUCs
)
```

### Advanced Features

```r
# Bootstrap confidence intervals
roc_bootstrap <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  bootstrapCI = TRUE,
  bootstrapReps = 2000
)

# Partial AUC (focus on high specificity region)
roc_partial <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  partialAUC = TRUE,
  partialAUCfrom = 0.8,  # Specificity range 80-100%
  partialAUCto = 1.0
)

# Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and IDI
roc_nri <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = c("PSA", "NewBiomarker"),
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  calculateIDI = TRUE,
  calculateNRI = TRUE,
  refVar = "PSA",  # Compare NewBiomarker against PSA
  nriThresholds = "0.2,0.5"  # Risk categories: <20%, 20-50%, >50%
)
```

### Visualization Options

```r
# Publication-ready plots
roc_publication <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = c("PSA", "CA125"),
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  plotROC = TRUE,
  cleanPlot = TRUE,           # Clean plot for publications
  showOptimalPoint = TRUE,    # Mark optimal cutpoint
  legendPosition = "bottomright"
)

# Additional diagnostic plots
roc_diagnostic <- psychopdaroc(
  data = cancer_biomarker,
  dependentVars = "PSA",
  classVar = "cancer_status",
  positiveClass = "1",
  showCriterionPlot = TRUE,   # Sensitivity/Specificity vs threshold
  showPrevalencePlot = TRUE,  # PPV/NPV vs prevalence
  showDotPlot = TRUE          # Distribution by class
)
```

## Vignette 2: Diagnostic Test Evaluation with `decision`

### Introduction

The `decision` function evaluates diagnostic test performance against a gold standard, calculating sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios.

### Basic Analysis

```r
# Evaluate a new rapid test against gold standard
decision_result <- decision(
  data = diagnostic_data,
  gold = "pcr_result",        # Gold standard test
  goldPositive = "positive",   # Positive level of gold standard
  newtest = "rapid_test",      # New test to evaluate
  testPositive = "positive"    # Positive level of new test
)
```

### Understanding the Output

The function provides:

1. **Confusion Matrix**: True positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives
2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Sensitivity: Proportion of true positives correctly identified
   - Specificity: Proportion of true negatives correctly identified
   - PPV: Probability of disease given positive test
   - NPV: Probability of no disease given negative test
   - Likelihood ratios: How much a test result changes disease probability

### Using Prior Probability

When the study population differs from the target population:

```r
# Adjust for population prevalence
decision_adjusted <- decision(
  data = diagnostic_data,
  gold = "pcr_result",
  goldPositive = "positive",
  newtest = "rapid_test",
  testPositive = "positive",
  pp = TRUE,                  # Use prior probability
  pprob = 0.05                # 5% prevalence in general population
)
```

### Confidence Intervals

```r
# Add 95% confidence intervals
decision_ci <- decision(
  data = diagnostic_data,
  gold = "pcr_result",
  goldPositive = "positive",
  newtest = "rapid_test",
  testPositive = "positive",
  ci = TRUE                   # Calculate confidence intervals
)
```

### Fagan Nomogram

Visualize how test results change disease probability:

```r
# Create Fagan nomogram
decision_fagan <- decision(
  data = diagnostic_data,
  gold = "pcr_result",
  goldPositive = "positive",
  newtest = "rapid_test",
  testPositive = "positive",
  fagan = TRUE                # Generate Fagan nomogram
)
```

## Vignette 3: Decision Calculator with `decisioncalculator`

### Introduction

When you have summary statistics instead of raw data, use `decisioncalculator`.

### Basic Usage

```r
# From a published 2x2 table
calc_result <- decisioncalculator(
  TP = 85,    # True positives
  FP = 15,    # False positives  
  FN = 10,    # False negatives
  TN = 90     # True negatives
)
```

### Adjusting for Prevalence

```r
# Adjust for different population prevalence
calc_adjusted <- decisioncalculator(
  TP = 85,
  FP = 15,
  FN = 10,
  TN = 90,
  pp = TRUE,
  pprob = 0.02  # 2% prevalence in screening population
)
```

### Interpreting Results

The calculator provides:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct classification rate
- **Prevalence**: Disease frequency in the study
- **Post-test probabilities**: Updated disease probability after testing
- **Likelihood ratios**: Diagnostic test strength

## Vignette 4: Interrater Reliability with `agreement`

### Introduction

The `agreement` function assesses how well multiple raters agree when classifying the same subjects.

### Two Raters (Cohen's Kappa)

```r
# Two pathologists rating tumor grades
kappa_result <- agreement(
  data = pathology_data,
  vars = c("pathologist1", "pathologist2")
)
```

### Interpretation:
- κ < 0.00: Poor agreement
- κ = 0.00-0.20: Slight agreement
- κ = 0.21-0.40: Fair agreement
- κ = 0.41-0.60: Moderate agreement
- κ = 0.61-0.80: Substantial agreement
- κ = 0.81-1.00: Almost perfect agreement

### Weighted Kappa for Ordinal Data

```r
# For ordinal categories (e.g., grades 1-5)
weighted_kappa <- agreement(
  data = pathology_data,
  vars = c("pathologist1", "pathologist2"),
  wght = "squared"  # Squared weights for ordinal data
)
```

### Multiple Raters (Fleiss' Kappa)

```r
# Three or more raters
fleiss_kappa <- agreement(
  data = radiology_data,
  vars = c("radiologist1", "radiologist2", "radiologist3", "radiologist4")
)
```

### Exact Kappa

```r
# For small samples with 3+ raters
exact_kappa <- agreement(
  data = small_study,
  vars = c("rater1", "rater2", "rater3"),
  exct = TRUE  # Use exact method
)
```

## Vignette 5: Power Analysis for Kappa with `kappaSizePower`

### Introduction

Plan sample sizes for interrater reliability studies.

### Basic Sample Size Calculation

```r
# Sample size for binary outcome
sample_size <- kappaSizePower(
  outcome = "2",           # Binary outcome
  kappa0 = 0.4,           # Null hypothesis: fair agreement
  kappa1 = 0.6,           # Alternative: moderate agreement
  props = "0.3, 0.7",     # 30% positive, 70% negative
  raters = "2",           # Two raters
  alpha = 0.05,           # Type I error rate
  power = 0.80            # Statistical power
)
```

### Multiple Categories

```r
# Sample size for 3-category outcome
sample_size_3cat <- kappaSizePower(
  outcome = "3",
  kappa0 = 0.4,
  kappa1 = 0.6,
  props = "0.2, 0.5, 0.3",  # Category proportions
  raters = "2",
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = 0.80
)
```

### Multiple Raters

```r
# Sample size for 3 raters
sample_size_3raters <- kappaSizePower(
  outcome = "2",
  kappa0 = 0.4,
  kappa1 = 0.6,
  props = "0.4, 0.6",
  raters = "3",             # Three raters
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = 0.80
)
```

## Vignette 6: Confidence Interval Approach with `kappaSizeCI`

### Introduction

Calculate sample size based on desired confidence interval width.

### Basic Usage

```r
# Sample size for precise kappa estimation
ci_sample_size <- kappaSizeCI(
  outcome = "2",
  kappa0 = 0.6,      # Expected kappa
  kappaL = 0.4,      # Lower CI bound
  kappaU = 0.8,      # Upper CI bound
  props = "0.2, 0.8",
  raters = "2",
  alpha = 0.05
)
```

### Planning for Publication

```r
# Narrow CI for publication standards
publication_size <- kappaSizeCI(
  outcome = "2",
  kappa0 = 0.7,      # Expected substantial agreement
  kappaL = 0.6,      # Lower bound still substantial
  kappaU = 0.8,      # Upper bound
  props = "0.3, 0.7",
  raters = "2",
  alpha = 0.05
)
```

## Vignette 7: Fixed Sample Size Analysis with `kappaSizeFixedN`

### Introduction

When sample size is predetermined, calculate expected kappa precision.

### Usage

```r
# What kappa precision with 100 subjects?
fixed_n_result <- kappaSizeFixedN(
  outcome = "2",
  kappa0 = 0.5,       # Expected kappa
  props = "0.4, 0.6",
  raters = "2",
  alpha = 0.05,
  n = 100             # Fixed sample size
)
```

### Feasibility Assessment

```r
# Check if available sample provides adequate precision
feasibility <- kappaSizeFixedN(
  outcome = "3",
  kappa0 = 0.6,
  props = "0.3, 0.4, 0.3",
  raters = "2",
  alpha = 0.05,
  n = 50              # Available subjects
)
```
