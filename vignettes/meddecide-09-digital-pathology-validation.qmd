## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates the enhanced agreement analysis and new modality comparison functions in ClinicoPathJamoviModule, specifically designed for digital pathology validation studies. These tools were developed based on the methodology from Xiao et al. (2025), who studied inter-observer variability in manual scoring of HER2 immunohistochemical stains on glass slides versus paired digital images.

## Key Features

### Enhanced Agreement Analysis

The `agreement` function now includes **consensus scoring capabilities**:
- Automated consensus determination using majority rule, super-majority, or unanimous methods
- Tie-breaking algorithms for cases without clear consensus  
- Detailed consensus statistics and case-by-case results
- Support for pathology-specific scoring systems (HER2, tumor grading)

### New Modality Comparison Function

The `modalitycomparison` function provides specialized analysis for digital pathology validation:
- Glass slide vs digital image comparison
- HER2 5-category scoring support (Null, Ultralow, 1+, 2+, 3+)
- Discordance pattern analysis with clinical significance assessment
- Directional bias detection (systematic differences between modalities)
- Low-end category focus for HER2-low/null distinction

## Example 1: Multi-Rater Agreement with Consensus Scoring

This example replicates the inter-observer agreement analysis from the original study.

```r
# Load the HER2 agreement dataset
library(ClinicoPath)
data("her2_agreement_data")

# Basic inter-rater agreement analysis
agreement_result <- ClinicoPath::agreement(
  data = her2_agreement_data,
  vars = c("pathologist_a", "pathologist_b", "pathologist_c"),
  wght = "unweighted",
  exct = FALSE,
  kripp = TRUE,
  krippMethod = "ordinal"
)

# Enhanced analysis with consensus scoring
consensus_result <- ClinicoPath::agreement(
  data = her2_agreement_data,
  vars = c("pathologist_a", "pathologist_b", "pathologist_c"),
  consensus = TRUE,
  consensus_method = "majority",  # ≥50% agreement
  tie_breaking = "exclude",       # Exclude tied cases
  show_consensus_table = TRUE,
  wght = "unweighted",
  exct = FALSE
)
```

**Key Results from Original Study:**
- Inter-observer agreement: κ = 0.82-0.87 (near perfect)
- Perfect concordance (3/3): 65.2% of cases (glass slides)
- Low-end spectrum agreement: κ = 0.66-0.70 (substantial)

## Example 2: Glass Slides vs Digital Images Comparison

This example demonstrates the core finding of the original study - comparing agreement between glass slides and digital images.

```r
# Load the modality comparison dataset
data("her2_modality_comparison")

# Comprehensive modality comparison
modality_result <- ClinicoPath::modalitycomparison(
  data = her2_modality_comparison,
  modality1_var = "glass_slides",
  modality2_var = "digital_images", 
  case_id = "case_id",
  modality1_name = "Glass Slides",
  modality2_name = "Digital Images",
  score_categories = "her2_5cat",           # HER2 5-category system
  show_discordance_analysis = TRUE,         # Detailed discordance patterns
  directional_analysis = TRUE,              # Systematic bias detection
  low_end_focus = TRUE,                     # HER2-low/null analysis
  show_contingency_table = TRUE,
  confidence_intervals = TRUE,
  show_plots = TRUE
)
```

**Key Findings Replicated:**
- Overall concordance: 89.9% (matches original study)
- Discordant cases: 10.1% (56 higher on digital, 19 higher on glass)
- Highest discordance in null (19.4%) and ultralow (15.7%) cases
- Digital images showed higher sensitivity at low staining levels

## Example 3: HER2-Low and Ultralow Category Analysis

Focus analysis on the clinically critical distinction between HER2-null and HER2-ultralow categories.

```r
# Specialized low-end analysis
low_end_result <- ClinicoPath::modalitycomparison(
  data = her2_modality_comparison,
  modality1_var = "glass_slides",
  modality2_var = "digital_images",
  case_id = "case_id", 
  score_categories = "her2_5cat",
  low_end_focus = TRUE,                     # Focus on Null, Ultralow, 1+
  show_discordance_analysis = TRUE,
  directional_analysis = TRUE,
  modality1_name = "Glass Slides",
  modality2_name = "Digital Images"
)
```

**Clinical Significance:**
- **Null → Ultralow**: Potential ADC therapy eligibility
- **Ultralow → 1+**: Confirms ADC therapy candidacy  
- **1+ → 2+**: May affect treatment decisions

## Example 4: Consensus Scoring for Challenging Cases

Demonstrate how consensus scoring helps with difficult diagnostic cases.

```r
# Load general pathology consensus data
data("pathology_consensus_study")

# Consensus analysis with super-majority requirement
consensus_analysis <- ClinicoPath::agreement(
  data = pathology_consensus_study,
  vars = c("pathologist_1", "pathologist_2", "pathologist_3", "pathologist_4"),
  consensus = TRUE,
  consensus_method = "super_majority",      # Require ≥2/3 agreement  
  tie_breaking = "arbitration",             # Flag ties for expert review
  show_consensus_table = TRUE,
  sft = TRUE,                              # Show frequency tables
  heatmap = TRUE                           # Agreement heatmap
)
```

## Clinical Applications

### HER2 Testing Validation
- **Digital Pathology Transition**: Validate that digital scoring maintains diagnostic accuracy
- **Inter-observer Standardization**: Identify pathologists needing additional training
- **HER2-Low Detection**: Ensure reliable identification of ADC therapy candidates

### Quality Assurance
- **Consensus Panels**: Automate consensus determination for tumor boards
- **Discordance Investigation**: Identify systematic scoring differences
- **Training Assessment**: Evaluate pathologist performance on challenging cases

## Statistical Interpretation

### Agreement Levels (Kappa Values)
- **0.81-1.00**: Almost Perfect - Suitable for clinical use
- **0.61-0.80**: Substantial - Generally acceptable, monitor closely  
- **0.41-0.60**: Moderate - May require additional training/calibration
- **≤0.40**: Poor - Significant intervention needed

### Consensus Achievement Rates
- **Unanimous (100%)**: Highest confidence cases
- **Super-majority (≥67%)**: High confidence, suitable for reporting
- **Majority (≥50%)**: Acceptable but monitor discordant cases
- **No consensus**: Require expert arbitration or additional sampling

## Advanced Features

### Weighted Kappa for Ordinal Scores
For ordered categories (HER2 scores), weighted kappa accounts for degree of disagreement:

```r
# Weighted kappa analysis
weighted_result <- ClinicoPath::modalitycomparison(
  data = her2_modality_comparison,
  modality1_var = "glass_slides", 
  modality2_var = "digital_images",
  calculate_weighted_kappa = TRUE,          # Account for ordered categories
  score_categories = "her2_5cat"
)
```

### Directional Bias Assessment
Systematic evaluation of whether one modality consistently scores higher:

```r
# Statistical test for systematic bias
bias_test <- ClinicoPath::modalitycomparison(
  data = her2_modality_comparison,
  modality1_var = "glass_slides",
  modality2_var = "digital_images", 
  directional_analysis = TRUE,              # Binomial test for bias
  confidence_intervals = TRUE
)
```

## Validation Against Published Results
