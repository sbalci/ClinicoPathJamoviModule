# Introduction to Decision Curve Analysis

Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) is a powerful method for evaluating the clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests. Unlike traditional performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC), DCA directly addresses the question: **"Would using this model lead to better clinical decisions?"**

## What Makes This Analysis Special?

### **Clinical Utility Focus**
- Moves beyond discrimination metrics to **real-world decision making**
- Incorporates the **relative harm** of false positives vs false negatives
- Provides **threshold-specific guidance** for clinical decisions
- Quantifies **net clinical benefit** across decision thresholds

### **Bayesian Enhancement**
- **Uncertainty quantification** through posterior distributions
- **Credible intervals** for net benefit estimates
- **Probability of superiority** between competing strategies
- **Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)** for research prioritization

## When to Use Decision Curve Analysis

**Perfect for:**
- Evaluating prediction models for clinical implementation
- Comparing diagnostic tests with different cost-benefit profiles
- Determining optimal decision thresholds for interventions
- Assessing value of additional biomarkers or clinical variables
- Health economic evaluation of diagnostic strategies

**Examples:**
- Should we implement a cancer screening model in practice?
- At what probability threshold should we recommend treatment?
- Is an expensive biomarker worth the additional cost?
- Which prediction model provides the most clinical benefit?

# Theoretical Foundation

## The Net Benefit Framework

Decision Curve Analysis is based on the **net benefit** metric:

$$NB = \text{Sensitivity} \times \text{Prevalence} - \text{False Positive Rate} \times (1-\text{Prevalence}) \times \frac{p_t}{1-p_t}$$

Where:
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate of the test/model
- **Prevalence**: Disease prevalence in the population
- **$p_t$**: Decision threshold (probability at which you would intervene)
- **$\frac{p_t}{1-p_t}$**: Odds ratio representing relative harm of false positives

## Understanding Decision Thresholds

The **decision threshold** represents the probability at which a clinician would recommend intervention:

- **Low thresholds (1-5%)**: Used when missing disease is very harmful (e.g., cancer screening)
- **Medium thresholds (10-20%)**: Balanced scenarios (e.g., cardiac interventions)  
- **High thresholds (30-50%)**: Used when intervention has significant risks (e.g., major surgery)

## Bayesian vs Frequentist Approaches

| Aspect | **Frequentist DCA** | **Bayesian DCA** |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Uncertainty** | Bootstrap confidence intervals | Posterior credible intervals |
| **Interpretation** | Long-run frequency properties | Probability statements about parameters |
| **Prior Information** | Not incorporated | Can incorporate expert knowledge |
| **Computational** | Bootstrap resampling | MCMC/analytical posteriors |
| **Decision Making** | Point estimates with CI | Full uncertainty distribution |

# Getting Started

## Load Required Libraries

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ClinicoPath)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Use the histopathology dataset for examples
data("histopathology")
mydata <- histopathology

# Display basic dataset information
cat("Dataset dimensions:", nrow(mydata), "rows ×", ncol(mydata), "columns\n")
cat("Outcome variable 'Death':", table(mydata$Death), "\n")
cat("Available predictors:", paste(c("Age", "Grade", "TStage", "MeasurementA", "MeasurementB"), collapse = ", "), "\n")
```

## Basic Workflow Overview

The Bayesian DCA workflow follows these steps:

1. **Define Binary Outcome**: Select outcome variable (0/1 or factor)
2. **Select Predictors**: Choose models/tests to evaluate (continuous probabilities or binary results)
3. **Set Thresholds**: Define clinically relevant decision threshold range
4. **Choose Analysis Type**: Bayesian (with uncertainty) or Frequentist (with bootstrap CI)
5. **Interpret Results**: Evaluate net benefit, probability of superiority, and EVPI

# Core Analysis Examples

## Example 1: Basic Bayesian Decision Curve Analysis

Let's evaluate whether age and tumor measurements can guide treatment decisions for cancer patients.

```{r basic-bayesian, eval=FALSE}
# Basic Bayesian DCA comparing age and measurements as predictors
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = c("Age", "MeasurementA", "MeasurementB"),
  thresholdMin = 0.05,     # 5% minimum threshold
  thresholdMax = 0.40,     # 40% maximum threshold
  thresholdPoints = 30,    # 30 evaluation points
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  nDraws = 2000,          # Number of posterior draws
  priorStrength = 2       # Weak prior
)
```

**What you get:**
- Net benefit curves with credible intervals
- Probability of each strategy being optimal
- Strategy comparison across thresholds
- Comprehensive statistical tables

## Example 2: Frequentist Analysis with Bootstrap

For comparison, run the same analysis using frequentist methods:

```{r frequentist-comparison, eval=FALSE}
# Frequentist DCA with bootstrap confidence intervals
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death", 
  predictors = c("Age", "MeasurementA", "MeasurementB"),
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.40,
  thresholdPoints = 30,
  bayesianAnalysis = FALSE,  # Use frequentist approach
  bootstrapCI = TRUE,
  bootstrapReps = 2000      # Bootstrap replications
)
```

**Differences:**
- Bootstrap confidence intervals instead of credible intervals
- No probability statements about superiority
- No EVPI calculations available

## Example 3: Binary Diagnostic Test Evaluation

Evaluate binary test results (e.g., imaging findings, genetic markers):

```{r binary-test, eval=FALSE}
# Convert measurements to binary tests for demonstration
mydata_binary <- mydata %>%
  mutate(
    HighMeasurementA = ifelse(MeasurementA > median(MeasurementA, na.rm = TRUE), 1, 0),
    PositiveGrade = ifelse(Grade %in% c("High"), 1, 0)
  )

# Analyze binary diagnostic tests
bayesdca(
  data = mydata_binary,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = c("HighMeasurementA", "PositiveGrade"),
  thresholdMin = 0.10,
  thresholdMax = 0.50,
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  nDraws = 2000
)
```

**Binary Test Features:**
- Tests are applied directly without threshold cutoffs
- Results show performance at different decision thresholds
- Useful for imaging findings, genetic tests, lab markers

## Example 4: External Prevalence Adjustment

When your study population differs from the target population:

```{r external-prevalence, eval=FALSE}
# Use external prevalence data (e.g., from registry)
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = c("Age", "MeasurementA"),
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.35,
  useExternalPrevalence = TRUE,
  externalCases = 150,      # Known cases in target population
  externalTotal = 1000,     # Total target population
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

**When to Use:**
- Study cohort has different characteristics than target population
- Registry data provides better prevalence estimates
- Multi-site validation with varying prevalence

# Advanced Features

## Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)

EVPI quantifies the **maximum value** of conducting additional research to reduce uncertainty:

```{r evpi-analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Full analysis with EVPI calculation
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = c("Age", "MeasurementA", "MeasurementB", "TStage"),
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.40,
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  calculateEVPI = TRUE,    # Enable EVPI calculation
  nDraws = 3000           # More draws for stable EVPI
)
```

**EVPI Interpretation:**
- **High EVPI**: Additional research would be valuable
- **Low EVPI**: Current evidence is sufficient for decision making
- **Peak EVPI**: Threshold ranges where research is most valuable
- **Zero EVPI**: Perfect certainty about optimal strategy

## Direction Control for Predictors

Control how continuous predictors are interpreted:

```{r direction-control, eval=FALSE}
# For biomarkers where LOWER values indicate risk
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = "MeasurementB",
  directionIndicator = "<=",  # Lower values = positive prediction
  thresholdMin = 0.10,
  thresholdMax = 0.40,
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

**Direction Options:**
- **">="**: Higher values indicate positive outcome (default)
- **"<="**: Lower values indicate positive outcome

## Prior Strength Sensitivity Analysis

Explore the impact of different prior specifications:

```{r prior-sensitivity, eval=FALSE}
# Weak prior (default)
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = "Age",
  priorStrength = 2,      # Weak prior
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)

# Strong prior (more conservative)
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death", 
  predictors = "Age",
  priorStrength = 10,     # Strong prior
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

**Prior Strength Guide:**
- **0.5-2**: Very weak prior (data-driven)
- **2-5**: Weak prior (default range)
- **5-10**: Moderate prior (conservative)
- **>10**: Strong prior (very conservative)

# Comprehensive Clinical Example

## Scenario: Cancer Treatment Decision Model

Let's work through a complete analysis for a cancer treatment decision model:

```{r comprehensive-example, eval=FALSE}
# Comprehensive cancer treatment decision analysis
cancer_dca <- bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  
  # Core variables
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = c("Age", "TStage", "MeasurementA", "MeasurementB"),
  
  # Threshold settings (5% to 40% - typical for cancer treatment)
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.40,
  thresholdPoints = 35,
  
  # Bayesian analysis with EVPI
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  nDraws = 3000,
  priorStrength = 2,
  calculateEVPI = TRUE,
  
  # External prevalence (if applicable)
  useExternalPrevalence = FALSE,
  
  # Classification direction
  directionIndicator = ">="
)
```

### Interpreting the Results

**1. Main Decision Curves:**
- Shows net benefit for each strategy across thresholds
- Curves above "treat none" and "treat all" indicate clinical utility
- Higher curves = better clinical performance

**2. Net Benefit Differences:**
- Shows improvement over default strategies (treat all/none)
- Positive values indicate beneficial use of the model
- Confidence bands show uncertainty in benefit

**3. Probability of Superiority:**
- Bayesian probability each strategy is optimal
- Helps identify threshold ranges where models are most reliable
- Values >80% suggest strong evidence for superiority

**4. Expected Value of Perfect Information:**
- Maximum benefit of reducing uncertainty through research
- High EVPI suggests value in additional studies
- Can inform research prioritization and funding decisions

## Parameter Selection Guidelines

### **Threshold Range Selection**

| Clinical Scenario | Suggested Range | Rationale |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Cancer Screening** | 1-10% | Missing cancer is very harmful |
| **Preventive Treatment** | 5-20% | Moderate intervention risks |
| **Major Surgery** | 20-50% | High intervention risks |
| **Emergency Decisions** | 1-15% | Time-sensitive, err on caution |

### **Analysis Type Selection**

| Choose **Bayesian** when: | Choose **Frequentist** when: |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Want probability statements | Prefer traditional CI interpretation |
| Need EVPI calculations | Simpler interpretation required |
| Have prior information | Want to avoid prior specification |
| Decision uncertainty matters | Bootstrap approach preferred |

### **Sample Size Considerations**

| Sample Size | Recommended Settings | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| **n < 100** | priorStrength = 5-10 | Use stronger priors |
| **100 ≤ n < 500** | priorStrength = 2-5 | Moderate priors |
| **n ≥ 500** | priorStrength = 1-2 | Weak priors, data-driven |

# Interpretation Guidelines

## Understanding Net Benefit Curves

### **Curve Interpretation**

```{r curve-interpretation, eval=FALSE}
# Example showing different curve patterns
# (This would be actual analysis output in practice)

# Pattern 1: Clear winner
# One model consistently above others
# Interpretation: Strong evidence for using this model

# Pattern 2: Threshold-dependent
# Different models optimal at different thresholds  
# Interpretation: Threshold selection matters

# Pattern 3: Minimal differences
# All models similar performance
# Interpretation: Simple approaches may suffice

# Pattern 4: No benefit
# All models below treat all/none
# Interpretation: Models not clinically useful
```

### **Clinical Decision Rules**

**When to Use a Model:**
1. Model curve is **above both "treat all" and "treat none"**
2. Net benefit difference is **clinically meaningful** (e.g., >0.01)
3. **Confidence/credible intervals** don't include zero benefit
4. **Probability of superiority** >80% in relevant threshold range

**When NOT to Use a Model:**
1. Model performs **worse than simple strategies**
2. **High uncertainty** with wide confidence intervals
3. **EVPI is very high** - need more research first
4. **Benefit is minimal** relative to implementation costs

## Statistical Significance vs Clinical Utility

**Traditional Metrics vs DCA:**

| Traditional Approach | DCA Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **AUC = 0.75** | "What's the net benefit at my decision threshold?" |
| **p < 0.05** | "Is the improvement clinically meaningful?" |
| **Sensitivity = 85%** | "Does this lead to better decisions?" |
| **95% CI excludes 1.0** | "What's the probability this strategy is best?" |

**Key Point**: A statistically significant model may have **no clinical utility** if the net benefit improvement is negligible.

# Clinical Application Examples

## Example 1: Cancer Screening Program

```{r cancer-screening, eval=FALSE}
# Evaluate biomarker panel for cancer screening
screening_analysis <- bayesdca(
  data = screening_cohort,
  outcomes = "Cancer",
  predictors = c("Biomarker_Panel", "Clinical_Score", "Imaging_Result"),
  
  # Low thresholds appropriate for screening
  thresholdMin = 0.01,     # 1% - very sensitive
  thresholdMax = 0.10,     # 10% - still screening range
  thresholdPoints = 20,
  
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  calculateEVPI = TRUE,
  
  # External prevalence from cancer registry
  useExternalPrevalence = TRUE,
  externalCases = 50,      # Registry cancer rate
  externalTotal = 1000     # Registry population
)
```

**Key Questions:**
- At what threshold should we recommend further testing?
- Is the biomarker panel worth the additional cost?
- Should we implement this in a screening program?

## Example 2: Treatment Selection Model

```{r treatment-selection, eval=FALSE}
# Personalized treatment selection model
treatment_analysis <- bayesdca(
  data = treatment_cohort,
  outcomes = "TreatmentFailure", 
  predictors = c("GenomicScore", "ClinicalModel", "Combined_Score"),
  
  # Moderate thresholds for treatment decisions
  thresholdMin = 0.15,     # 15% - consider treatment
  thresholdMax = 0.45,     # 45% - high-risk threshold
  thresholdPoints = 30,
  
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  priorStrength = 3,       # Moderate prior for treatment
  calculateEVPI = TRUE
)
```

**Key Questions:**
- Which patients should receive intensive treatment?
- Is genomic testing worth the cost for treatment selection?
- What threshold should guide treatment decisions?

## Example 3: Diagnostic Test Evaluation

```{r diagnostic-evaluation, eval=FALSE}
# Compare diagnostic tests for rapid diagnosis
diagnostic_analysis <- bayesdca(
  data = diagnostic_cohort,
  outcomes = "Disease",
  predictors = c("Rapid_Test", "Standard_Test", "Combined_Tests"),
  
  # Broad threshold range for diagnostic evaluation
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.50,
  thresholdPoints = 45,
  
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE,
  calculateEVPI = TRUE,
  
  # Direction: positive test results indicate disease
  directionIndicator = ">="
)
```

**Key Questions:**
- Should we replace the standard test with the rapid test?
- At what probability should we initiate treatment?
- Is the combined approach worth the additional complexity?

# Advanced Topics

## Handling Complex Prediction Models

### **Probability Calibration**

```{r probability-calibration, eval=FALSE}
# For machine learning models, ensure probabilities are well-calibrated
# before DCA analysis

# Example with logistic regression calibration
library(rms)

# Calibrate predictions
calibrated_probs <- predict(calibration_model, type = "response")

# Use calibrated probabilities in DCA
bayesdca(
  data = mydata,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = "calibrated_probs",
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.40,
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

### **Multi-class Outcomes**

```{r multiclass, eval=FALSE}
# For outcomes with multiple categories, create binary versions
mydata_binary <- mydata %>%
  mutate(
    Death_vs_Others = ifelse(Outcome == "Death", 1, 0),
    Progression_vs_Others = ifelse(Outcome == "Progression", 1, 0)
  )

# Analyze each binary outcome separately
bayesdca(data = mydata_binary, outcomes = "Death_vs_Others", ...)
bayesdca(data = mydata_binary, outcomes = "Progression_vs_Others", ...)
```

## Model Validation Considerations

### **Cross-validation Strategy**

```{r cross-validation, eval=FALSE}
# For internal validation, use cross-validation
library(pROC)

# Example 5-fold cross-validation
set.seed(123)
folds <- createFolds(mydata$Death, k = 5)

cv_results <- list()
for(i in 1:5) {
  train_data <- mydata[-folds[[i]], ]
  test_data <- mydata[folds[[i]], ]
  
  # Fit model on training data
  model <- glm(Death ~ Age + MeasurementA, data = train_data, family = binomial)
  
  # Predict on test data
  test_data$predictions <- predict(model, test_data, type = "response")
  
  # Run DCA on test predictions
  cv_results[[i]] <- bayesdca(
    data = test_data,
    outcomes = "Death", 
    predictors = "predictions",
    bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
  )
}
```

### **External Validation**

```{r external-validation, eval=FALSE}
# For external validation on independent dataset
external_results <- bayesdca(
  data = external_cohort,
  outcomes = "Death",
  predictors = "model_predictions",  # From original model
  
  # May need different threshold range
  thresholdMin = 0.05,
  thresholdMax = 0.35,
  
  # Account for different prevalence
  useExternalPrevalence = TRUE,
  externalCases = external_cases,
  externalTotal = external_total,
  
  bayesianAnalysis = TRUE
)
```

## Cost-Effectiveness Integration

### **Incorporating Costs**

```{r cost-effectiveness, eval=FALSE}
# DCA can be extended to include costs
# Net benefit becomes: NB = (TP × Benefit - FP × Harm) / Cost

# Example: Modify net benefit calculation for cost-effectiveness
# This would require custom calculation outside the standard DCA framework

cost_adjusted_analysis <- function(dca_results, intervention_cost, harm_cost) {
  # Custom function to adjust net benefit for costs
  # Implementation would depend on specific cost structure
}
```

# Troubleshooting and Best Practices

## Common Issues and Solutions

### **Data Preparation Issues**

**Problem**: Outcome variable not properly coded
```{r data-prep-issues, eval=FALSE}
# Solution: Ensure binary coding
mydata$outcome_binary <- ifelse(mydata$Outcome == "Event", 1, 0)
# Or specify positive level for factors
bayesdca(..., outcomes = "Status", outcomePos = "Dead")
```

**Problem**: Prediction probabilities outside [0,1] range
```{r prob-range, eval=FALSE}
# Solution: Check and constrain predictions
summary(mydata$predictions)
mydata$predictions <- pmin(pmax(mydata$predictions, 0.001), 0.999)
```

**Problem**: Missing values in predictors
```{r missing-values, eval=FALSE}
# Solution: Handle missing values appropriately
# Remove cases with missing predictors
complete_data <- mydata[complete.cases(mydata[, c("outcome", "predictor1", "predictor2")]), ]

# Or impute missing values (use appropriate method)
library(mice)
imputed_data <- complete(mice(mydata))
```

### **Threshold Selection Issues**

**Problem**: Unclear what threshold range to use
```{r threshold-selection, eval=FALSE}
# Solution: Use clinical guidelines or literature
# For cancer: often 5-20%
# For screening: often 1-10% 
# For surgery: often 20-50%

# Start broad and narrow based on results
bayesdca(..., thresholdMin = 0.01, thresholdMax = 0.50)
```

**Problem**: All models perform similarly
```{r similar-performance, eval=FALSE}
# Solutions:
# 1. Check if sample size is adequate
# 2. Consider if models are actually different
# 3. Look at EVPI - high values suggest more research needed
# 4. Focus on interpretability and implementation costs
```

### **Interpretation Challenges**

**Problem**: Negative net benefit values
```{r negative-nb, eval=FALSE}
# This is normal and expected!
# Net benefit can be negative - it just means the strategy
# performs worse than "treat none"
# Focus on relative differences between strategies
```

**Problem**: Very wide confidence intervals
```{r wide-ci, eval=FALSE}
# Solutions:
# 1. Increase sample size if possible
# 2. Use stronger priors (increase priorStrength)
# 3. Consider if more research is needed (check EVPI)
# 4. Focus on threshold ranges with narrow intervals
```

## Performance Optimization

### **Large Dataset Handling**

```{r large-datasets, eval=FALSE}
# For large datasets (>10,000 observations)
# Consider reducing computational burden

# Reduce posterior draws for initial exploration
bayesdca(..., nDraws = 1000)  # Instead of 2000+

# Reduce threshold points for initial analysis
bayesdca(..., thresholdPoints = 20)  # Instead of 50+

# Use frequentist approach for speed
bayesdca(..., bayesianAnalysis = FALSE, bootstrapCI = TRUE)
```

### **Memory Management**

```{r memory-management, eval=FALSE}
# For memory-intensive analyses
# Clean up intermediate objects
gc()

# Use data.table for large datasets
library(data.table)
setDT(mydata)
```

# Integration with ClinicoPath Workflow

## Recommended Analysis Sequence

1. **Exploratory Analysis**: Use other ClinicoPath modules for initial exploration
2. **Model Development**: Develop prediction models using appropriate methods
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess discrimination (ROC analysis)
4. **Clinical Utility**: Use Bayesian DCA to evaluate real-world utility
5. **Implementation Planning**: Use EVPI and cost considerations for decisions

## Complement with Other Modules

### **ROC Analysis First**
```{r roc-first, eval=FALSE}
# Step 1: Traditional ROC analysis
roc_analysis <- roc(data = mydata, outcomes = "Death", predictors = "Age")

# Step 2: Decision curve analysis for clinical utility
dca_analysis <- bayesdca(data = mydata, outcomes = "Death", predictors = "Age")
```

### **Decision Trees for Implementation**
```{r decision-trees, eval=FALSE}
# Use decision tree analysis for implementation planning
# after DCA shows clinical utility
decision_tree_analysis <- decisiongraph(...)
```

### **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
```{r cost-effectiveness-integration, eval=FALSE}
# Integrate DCA results with cost-effectiveness models
# for full economic evaluation
```

# Reporting Guidelines

## Essential Elements for Publication

## Figure Quality

### **Publication-Ready Plots**
```{r publication-plots, eval=FALSE}
# The Bayesian DCA module produces publication-ready plots
# with proper formatting:
# - Professional color schemes
# - Percentage formatting for thresholds  
# - Appropriate confidence bands
# - Clear legends and labels

# Plots can be exported at high resolution for publications
```

# Conclusion

Bayesian Decision Curve Analysis represents a sophisticated approach to evaluating the clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests. By focusing on real-world decision making rather than just statistical performance, DCA provides crucial insights for clinical implementation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Clinical Utility Matters**: A statistically significant model may have no clinical benefit
2. **Thresholds Are Critical**: Performance varies dramatically across decision thresholds
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian approaches provide richer uncertainty information
4. **Research Prioritization**: EVPI helps identify where additional research is most valuable
5. **Implementation Focus**: DCA directly addresses "should we use this in practice?"

## When DCA Changes Clinical Practice

- **Identifies optimal decision thresholds** for existing interventions
- **Prevents implementation** of models with no clinical utility despite good discrimination
- **Guides resource allocation** by quantifying value of additional research
- **Supports evidence-based policy** for screening and diagnostic programs
- **Enables personalized medicine** by identifying patient subgroups who benefit most

The ClinicoPath Bayesian DCA module provides a comprehensive toolkit for this sophisticated analysis, making advanced decision-theoretic methods accessible to clinical researchers and supporting evidence-based implementation of prediction models in healthcare.
