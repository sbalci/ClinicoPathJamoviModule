# AGENTS Reference (Archived)

This file preserves a link to the previous long-form AGENTS guide that lived in `AGENTS.md` before it was replaced by the concise contributor guide.

To retrieve the full historical content into a new file locally, run:

```
GIT_PAGER=cat git show HEAD:AGENTS.md > AGENTS_REFERENCE_full.md
```

Notes
- The archived document covers agent roles (ModuleArchitectAgent, YAMLConfigAgent, RFunctionGenAgent, PlotDesignAgent, TestQAAgent, etc.), handoffs, acceptance checklists, and implementation patterns for Jamovi modules.
- Keep this reference read-only. New contributor-facing guidance should go in `AGENTS.md` (Repository Guidelines).
