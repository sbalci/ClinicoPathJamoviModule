Statistical Methods in Digital Pathology Research

Digital pathology studies often generate quantitative data from whole-slide images (WSIs), regions of interest (ROIs), segmented cells, and classified tissues. A variety of classical statistical methods are used to analyze these data, from basic hypothesis tests to regression models and survival analysis. Many of these methods are implementable in R (and hence can be integrated as jamovi modules) via existing packages. Below we outline common statistical approaches, their use cases in digital pathology, and relevant implementations:

Hypothesis Testing for Group Differences

Pathology image analyses frequently compare quantitative features between groups – for example, comparing cell densities or biomarker levels between tumor types or outcome groups. t-Tests (for two groups) and ANOVA (for multiple groups) are standard tools for such comparisons. For instance, one study of salivary gland tumors used two-tailed t-tests and one-way ANOVA to evaluate differences in geometric, spatial, and staining features between benign and malignant tumors ￼. Such tests can reveal if an image-derived metric (e.g. average nucleus size or cell count) significantly differs across conditions. Non-parametric alternatives like the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test are used when data violate normality.

For categorical outcomes, chi-square tests (or Fisher’s exact test for small samples) are used to assess associations. In digital pathology, a chi-square test might examine whether the presence of a certain tissue feature (e.g. necrosis vs no necrosis) is associated with a clinical outcome or another categorical variable. Jamovi (via its base modules or extensions) readily performs t-tests, ANOVAs, and chi-square tests, making these straightforward to implement. In fact, the ClinicoPath module in jamovi supports generating cross-tabulations with appropriate statistical tests for clinicopathological data ￼.

Use Case Example: In a tumor study, researchers might test if the mean tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) count differs between patients who responded to therapy and those who did not. A two-sample t-test (or non-parametric equivalent) can be applied to the TIL counts of the two groups to check for a significant difference. Similarly, if comparing multiple tumor subtypes, ANOVA with post-hoc tests would be used to identify which subtypes differ in average TIL count ￼.

Regression Models for Image-Derived Data

Regression analysis is widely used to model relationships between pathology features and outcomes:
 • Linear Regression: If a continuous outcome is of interest (e.g. a gene expression level or a quantitative pathology score), linear regression can model its relationship with image-derived predictors (such as morphometric features). For example, one might regress a molecular proliferation index on digital image features like nuclear size and mitotic count to quantify how well the image features predict the index. Linear models are implemented in base R (lm) and accessible through jamovi’s regression menus ￼.
 • Logistic Regression: This is especially common for binary outcomes (e.g. disease vs. normal tissue, responder vs. non-responder). In digital pathology, logistic regression can predict the probability of an outcome based on image features or ROI measurements. A published study on rectal cancer biopsies used multivariable logistic regression to test if features from a segmentation algorithm (QuantCRC) were associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) to therapy ￼. The model provided odds ratios (e.g. an odds ratio per unit increase in TIL count) to quantify risk ￼. R’s glm function (with family=binomial) and packages like finalfit make implementing logistic models straightforward, and jamovi’s ClinicoPath module even includes an “Odds Ratio Analysis” specifically geared for binary outcomes ￼.
 • Ordinal/Multinomial Regression: When outcomes have more than two categories or are ordinal (e.g. tissue grades, pathology scoring systems), ordinal logistic or multinomial logistic regression can be applied. For instance, predicting tissue class (normal vs. low-grade vs. high-grade) from image features may require a multinomial model. R packages like MASS (for ordinal logistic via polr) can handle this, and such methods could be wrapped in a jamovi module (though these are slightly more specialized).
 • Poisson/Negative Binomial Regression: Count data arising from image analysis (such as number of mitoses, or count of metastases per case) can be modeled by Poisson regression. If counts are overdispersed, a negative binomial model (via the MASS::glm.nb function) is appropriate. These models are useful, for example, in modeling the number of positive lymph nodes detected per slide as a function of digital features.
 • Machine Learning Methods (Random Forest, etc.): In addition to classical regressions, conventional machine-learning models like random forests are often applied to pathology features ￼. Random forests can classify tissues or predict outcomes based on numerous image features without requiring a linear relationship. For example, in a study of salivary gland tumors, researchers built a Random Forest classifier on ROI-derived features to distinguish benign from malignant cases ￼. This yielded high accuracy, comparable to deep learning methods ￼. While random forests are not “classical” statistics, they are implemented in R (randomForest, ranger packages) and could be integrated into jamovi as a module (indeed, third-party jamovi modules for decision trees and random forests exist). Likewise, other ML methods like support vector machines or penalized regressions (lasso, ridge) are available via R packages (e.g. e1071 for SVM, glmnet for lasso) and could be used in digital pathology research for classification tasks.

Use Case Example: A logistic regression model might use features such as tumor area percentage and nuclear pleomorphism (quantified from WSIs) to predict whether a patient falls into a high-risk group. The model would yield an odds ratio for each feature, indicating how a one-unit change in the feature affects the odds of high-risk status ￼. In another scenario, a Random Forest could be trained to classify ROI images into tumor vs. healthy tissue based on texture and color features, outputting an importance ranking of features. All these models can be developed in R and their results (coefficients, feature importance, etc.) interpreted within the pathology context.

Survival Analysis for Outcomes

When pathology data are used to predict patient outcomes over time (such as overall survival or disease-free survival), survival analysis methods are essential. Two cornerstone techniques are:
 • Kaplan-Meier Estimation and Log-Rank Test: Kaplan-Meier curves estimate the survival function for different patient groups (for example, patients whose tumor has a certain image feature vs. those who do not). In digital pathology, one might stratify patients by an image-derived biomarker (e.g. “high vs. low TIL density”) and plot Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each group. The log-rank test checks if the survival curves differ significantly. For instance, using a cutoff (like the ≥10.1% high tumor grade in QuantCRC features), researchers found distinct 5-year recurrence-free survival rates between groups and a significant difference by log-rank test ￼. R’s survival package (survfit and survdiff) provides these analyses, and jamovi’s ClinicoPath module includes easy-to-use survival tables and plots ￼.
 • Cox Proportional Hazards Regression: Cox regression models the hazard (risk) of an event as a function of covariates, and is widely used to assess prognostic significance of pathology features. Digital pathology studies often employ multivariable Cox models to test if an image feature independently predicts outcome when adjusting for clinical factors. For example, in the rectal cancer study, a multivariate Cox model showed that the percentage of high-grade tumor area (from image analysis) was independently associated with worse recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio 1.27, P = 0.002) ￼. Cox models can incorporate multiple image features and output hazard ratios for each. They are implemented in R (coxph in the survival package) and featured in jamovi’s survival analysis module ￼.

Additional survival tools such as time-dependent ROC curves for survival predictions or competing risks analysis can also be implemented in R (packages like survminer or timeROC). Jamovi’s ClinicoPath (via the jsurvival module) supports many survival functions, providing Kaplan-Meier curves with confidence intervals, risk tables, and even natural-language result summaries ￼ ￼.

Use Case Example: A researcher investigating a digital pathology biomarker might divide patients into “biomarker-high” and “biomarker-low” groups based on WSI analysis, then use Kaplan-Meier curves to visualize survival differences. A log-rank test would indicate if the difference is statistically significant. Subsequently, a Cox regression could be run with the biomarker and other covariates (age, stage, etc.) to confirm the biomarker’s independent prognostic value ￼. These analyses are readily performed in R (with packages like survival and survminer) and through jamovi’s dedicated survival analysis interface ￼.

Classification Performance and Diagnostic Accuracy

Many digital pathology projects develop classifiers (e.g. to detect cancer vs. normal tissue, or to classify subtypes). Evaluating such classifiers involves statistical measures and tests:
 • Confusion Matrix Metrics: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy are basic metrics derived from the confusion matrix of predictions vs. ground truth. In computational pathology, for example, if an algorithm identifies tumor in WSIs, one would compute sensitivity (recall) and specificity against pathologist annotations. Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUROC (Area Under the ROC Curve) are also widely reported ￼. In the salivary gland tumor study, the Random Forest achieved an F1-score of 0.95 and high AUROC on the test set ￼. These metrics quantify performance; an F1 combines precision and recall, while AUROC summarizes the true-positive vs. false-positive rate tradeoff. R has packages like pROC for ROC curves and base functions for confusion matrices; jamovi’s ClinicoPath module includes a “Diagnostic Accuracy” suite that can generate ROC curves and even decision curve analysis ￼.
 • ROC Curve Analysis: ROC curves plot sensitivity vs. 1-specificity for a continuous prediction or varying decision thresholds. They are often used in pathology to choose an optimal cutoff for a biomarker (for instance, finding a threshold of cell proliferation index that best distinguishes outcome groups). The ROC AUC provides a single measure of discrimination ability. In R, pROC or ROCR packages can produce ROC curves, and jamovi modules (e.g. ClinicoPath’s meddecide submodule) facilitate ROC analysis and even calculation of best threshold by Youden’s index.
 • Comparative Tests for Classifiers: When comparing two classification methods on the same dataset (say, an AI model vs. a pathologist), statistical tests like McNemar’s test are employed to assess whether their error rates differ significantly. McNemar’s test (available in base R as mcnemar.test) uses the paired confusion outcomes to yield a p-value for difference in performance. This is useful, for example, to test if a new algorithm’s accuracy significantly exceeds that of an older algorithm or an existing standard.
 • Diagnostic $κ$ and Agreement:** For tasks like tissue classification or ROI detection, Cohen’s kappa statistic is often reported as it accounts for chance agreement between two raters (or between an algorithm and ground truth). A kappa value provides insight into how reliably a pathology feature is identified. If multiple algorithms label tissue regions, kappa can measure their agreement. R’s irr or psych packages compute kappa; jamovi’s agreement analysis (in ClinicoPath or the base “Reliability” module) includes Cohen’s Kappa ￼.
 • Example: Suppose an algorithm segments tumor vs. normal tissue on WSIs. One can calculate sensitivity (percentage of true tumor area correctly identified) and specificity (normal tissue correctly excluded). If the algorithm’s output is binary tumor/not tumor for each image, an ROC curve could be constructed by varying the threshold of detection. Additionally, comparing the algorithm to a human pathologist’s segmentation might involve calculating a kappa statistic to quantify agreement beyond chance. Jamovi’s diagnostic tools (backed by R) can generate these metrics and plots ￼.

Agreement and Reproducibility Analyses

Digital pathology often involves comparisons between observers or methods – for example, comparing two pathologists’ ROI annotations, or evaluating consistency between manual and automated counts. Statistical methods to quantify reliability include:
 • Inter-rater Reliability Coefficients: Cohen’s Kappa (as noted above) for categorical ratings (e.g. presence/absence or grade categories) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for continuous measurements (e.g. continuous percentage of tumor area, cell count per mm²) are key metrics. These assess how well two or more raters (or methods) agree. An ICC can evaluate, for instance, if an image analysis algorithm produces cell density measurements in close agreement with a pathologist’s counts across a series of slides. Jamovi’s ClinicoPath module provides functions for ICC and Kappa ￼, leveraging R’s psych or irr in the background.
 • Bland-Altman Analysis: Although not always seen, Bland-Altman plots/statistics are a method to assess agreement in continuous measurements by examining the mean difference and limits of agreement. This could be applied if, say, an automated image analysis yields a tumor cellularity percentage and one wants to see how it differs from a pathologist’s estimated cellularity. R has implementations (e.g. in BlandAltmanLeh package) and such analysis could be incorporated into a custom jamovi module if needed.
 • Reproducibility of Segmentations: In segmentation tasks, one may analyze variability across repeats or methods. For example, if two segmentations of the same ROI are available, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is a common overlap metric. While DSC itself is a single number, studies have treated it statistically: one paper logit-transformed DSC values and used ANOVA to compare segmentation accuracy across conditions ￼. In pathology, if multiple algorithms segment a tumor region, one could compute DSC for each algorithm vs. ground truth and perform a paired t-test or ANOVA to see if one algorithm is significantly more accurate. R can compute DSC (simply as an index) and standard tests; a jamovi module could be devised to automate significance testing of segmentation metrics.

Use Case Example: If three pathologists delineate tumor regions on the same slides, we might measure agreement by calculating pairwise kappa values or an ICC (treating each delineation’s measured tumor area as a continuous value). High agreement statistics would indicate reliable ROI annotation. If an automated tool is introduced, its agreement with the consensus of experts can also be quantified similarly. In jamovi, one could use the ClinicoPath’s reliability tools to get kappa/ICC outputs ￼, assisting pathology researchers in quantifying consistency.

Spatial Analysis of Cell Patterns

A unique aspect of digital pathology is the spatial organization of cells and structures within tissue. Spatial statistical methods help quantify patterns in cell locations obtained from segmentation or ROI data:
 • Spatial Point Pattern Analysis: Techniques like Ripley’s K-function and G-function, as well as nearest-neighbor distance analyses (e.g. Clark-Evans test), are used to determine if cells are randomly distributed, clustered, or uniformly spaced ￼. In tumor microenvironment studies, these methods can quantify clustering of immune cells or assess whether tumor cells tend to invade in clusters. For example, Ripley’s K can evaluate if CD8+ T-cells in a tumor are more clustered than would be expected by chance, across multiple spatial scales ￼. R’s spatstat package is a powerful framework for such analysis, providing functions for K-function, pair correlation function, etc., which are directly applicable to coordinates of cells segmented from WSIs.
 • Multi-type Spatial Analysis: In tissues with multiple cell phenotypes (e.g. tumor cells, T-cells, macrophages), extensions of these methods (like the multitype Ripley’s K or mark correlation functions) assess interactions between cell types ￼. This can reveal, for instance, whether immune cells preferentially cluster around tumor cells (indicating an immune response pattern) or avoid them.
 • Spatial Autocorrelation: For quantifiable features across an image (e.g. an intensity or density map), measures like Moran’s I or Geary’s C can test if high values cluster spatially. In digital pathology, one might divide a whole slide into patches and measure something like density of tumor, then use spatial autocorrelation to see if high-density patches are adjacent.
 • Areal/Regional Analysis: If ROI annotations divide a tissue into regions (tumor vs stroma regions, for example), one can analyze differences or interactions at the region level. Join-count statistics could be used for binary patterns (e.g. whether tumor regions are adjacent more often than random), though these are less common in pathology literature compared to point-pattern methods.
 • R Implementations: The SpatialQPFs package (recently introduced by Genentech) provides an R toolkit to extract many spatial features from cell coordinate data using these statistical methods ￼. This includes point process analyses (like K-function), areal analyses, and geostatistical measures within a unified framework. Such packages underline that spatial stats can be harnessed without needing deep learning – offering interpretable metrics of tissue organization.

Use Case Example: Consider a study evaluating the “immune contexture” of tumors. After cell segmentation and phenotyping (e.g. identifying lymphocytes and cancer cells in an image), researchers can use Ripley’s K-function to test if lymphocytes are clustered around tumor cells beyond random expectation ￼. A significant deviation in the K-function indicates spatial clustering, which might correlate with prognosis or response to therapy. All computations can be done in R (spatstat.explore::Kcross for multitype K, etc.), and while jamovi doesn’t have a built-in spatial analysis module, one could integrate these R functions into a custom jamovi extension for pathologists less familiar with coding. The results of spatial analyses (graphs of K-function, p-values for clustering) complement classical analyses by adding insight into tissue architecture.

Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

Digital pathology datasets often yield a large number of features (morphological, intensity, texture features, etc.). Dimensionality reduction and clustering methods help make sense of high-dimensional data:
 • Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is used to reduce many correlated features into a few composite variables (principal components) that capture the majority of variance. In pathology, PCA might be applied to a set of image features extracted from ROIs to identify principal axes of variation (e.g. one component might capture size-related variance, another color-related variance). PCA can also help visualize cases in a low-dimensional space to see natural groupings. R’s prcomp or FactoMineR can perform PCA, and jamovi’s base “Factor” module supports PCA for users who prefer a GUI.
 • Clustering Algorithms: Unsupervised clustering (like k-means, hierarchical clustering, or clustering heatmaps) can group either features or observations. A researcher might cluster patients based on their multi-feature profiles from pathology images to discover subgroups (for example, a cluster with high immune infiltration features vs. a cluster with low immune features). This can reveal phenotypic subtypes without prior labels. R has many clustering implementations (base hclust, kmeans, and advanced packages like cluster), and results can be visualized as dendrograms or heatmaps. While jamovi doesn’t natively focus on clustering in its standard modules, results from R can be imported or an extension could be made.
 • Use in Pathology: For example, a set of ROI-level texture features could undergo PCA to see if a single index captures “overall textural heterogeneity”. Meanwhile, hierarchical clustering could be used on WSI feature profiles to see if cases naturally separate by known categories (e.g. do known tumor grades cluster together based on quantitative features?). These exploratory methods often precede formal hypothesis testing or model building, and they leverage classical statistical techniques (eigen-decomposition for PCA, distance metrics for clustering) available in R.

Practical Integration into R and jamovi

Nearly all the methods above have robust R packages and many are already part of user-friendly tools:
 • R Packages: Classical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square) are in base R (t.test, aov, chisq.test). Regression and survival have canonical packages (stats, survival). Specialized tasks have community packages: finalfit helps create regression tables common in clinicopathological research, survminer for survival plots, pROC for ROC analysis, irr for reliability, spatstat for spatial analysis, etc. This rich ecosystem means digital pathology researchers can apply rigorous statistics to image data with relative ease.
 • jamovi Modules: Jamovi, which uses R under the hood, already includes many classical analyses in its GUI. For more advanced or domain-specific needs, modules like ClinicoPath provide a suite tailored to pathology/clinical research. As described by Balci (2024), ClinicoPath offers descriptive stats (Table 1 generation), survival analysis (KM curves, Cox models), diagnostic test evaluation (ROC, decision curve analysis), and reliability stats (Kappa, ICC) all in one place ￼. These cover the most common statistical analyses needed in pathology studies. The module is built on R packages (it lists dependencies on survival, survminer, finalfit, etc.) and demonstrates that integrating an R method into jamovi is feasible and practical ￼ ￼.
 • Straightforward Integration: If a needed method isn’t yet in jamovi, one can often create a custom module or use jamovi’s R syntax mode to run R code. For instance, if spatial analysis or PCA is required, an R-savvy user can run spatstat or prcomp within jamovi’s R terminal. Alternatively, developing a module (as some have for machine learning algorithms like decision trees/random forests) can expose these to point-and-click users. The modular nature of jamovi means that as long as an R package exists for a method, it can be wrapped with a GUI relatively easily. This opens the door to implementing even niche analyses (e.g. a “Spatial Stats” module for digital pathology could wrap SpatialQPFs functions to compute Ripley’s K, etc., with minimal coding).

In summary, classical statistical methods remain critical in digital pathology for validating findings and extracting insights from image data. From simple t-tests comparing image-derived metrics between conditions ￼, to regression models linking image features with clinical outcomes ￼, to survival analyses for prognostication ￼, these techniques provide the quantitative backbone for research conclusions. Moreover, the availability of these methods in R (and by extension in jamovi modules) makes them accessible to researchers without advanced programming skills. By leveraging such statistical tools – often through existing R packages – digital pathology studies can robustly analyze ROI annotations, cell segmentation results, and tissue classifications, complementing the more complex machine learning algorithms with sound statistical validation and interpretation. ￼ ￼
