# AGENTS Reference â€” Full (from Git history)

Due to sandbox restrictions, this file cannot be auto-populated from git history in this environment. To restore the full previous `AGENTS.md` content locally, run:

```
GIT_PAGER=cat git show HEAD:AGENTS.md > vignettes/AGENTS_REFERENCE_full.md
```

This will write the exact historical content into this file.
