## 30-Second Decision Guide

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Distance Metrics at a Glance

| Metric | Best For | When to Use | Example Panel |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Chi-squared** ⭐ | Binary/ordinal | Default choice for pos/neg markers | TTF1, p40, CK7, CK20 |
| **Jaccard** | Sparse binary | Many double-negatives | PAX8, RCC, CD10 (renal) |
| **Euclidean** ⭐ | Continuous | H-scores, % positive | PSA, NKX3.1, Ki67 |
| **Manhattan** | Continuous w/ outliers | Robust to extreme values | Ki67 with outliers |

## Interpreting Distance Values

```
Distance    Meaning                 Action
────────────────────────────────────────────────
0.0 - 0.2   Nearly identical       ⚠️ One marker likely redundant
0.2 - 0.4   Very similar           Consider clinical context
0.4 - 0.6   Moderately different   Probably keep both
0.6 - 0.8   Different              Definitely keep both
0.8 - 1.0   Completely distinct    Independent information
```

---

## Reading the Dendrogram

```
        CK7 ──┐         ← Low merge height
        MUC6──┴──┐      ← Markers are similar
                 │
        MUC5AC───┴─┐    ← Medium height
                   ├─── ← High merge height
        CDX2───────┤    ← Markers are different
        MUC2───────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Low height = markers co-express (may be redundant)
- High height = markers independent (keep both)
- Red line = significance threshold

---

## Common Clinical Scenarios

### Lung (Adeno vs Squamous)
```
Panel: TTF1, Napsin A, p40, CK5/6
Distance Metric: Chi-squared ⭐

Expected:
├─ TTF1 + Napsin A cluster (distance ~0.2)
└─ p40 + CK5/6 cluster (distance ~0.2)

Optimization:
✅ Keep: TTF1 + p40 (one from each cluster)
❌ Drop: Napsin A or CK5/6 (redundant)
```

### Breast (Molecular Subtype)
```
Panel: ER, PR, HER2, Ki67%
Distance Metric: Mixed ⭐

Expected:
├─ ER + PR moderate clustering (distance ~0.3)
└─ HER2, Ki67 independent

Optimization:
✅ Keep all (prognostic value despite ER-PR redundancy)
```

### GI (Site of Origin)
```
Panel: CK7, CK20, CDX2, SATB2
Distance Metric: Chi-squared or Jaccard

Expected:
├─ CDX2 + SATB2 cluster (distance ~0.1)
└─ CK7 independent

Optimization:
✅ Keep: CK7 + CDX2
❌ Drop: SATB2 (redundant with CDX2)
```

### Renal (ccRCC vs pRCC)
```
Panel: PAX8, RCC, CD10, CK7
Distance Metric: Jaccard ⭐ (sparse positivity)

Expected:
├─ PAX8 + RCC + CD10 cluster (distance ~0.1)
└─ CK7 separate (discriminates subtypes)

Optimization:
✅ Keep: PAX8 + CK7
❌ Drop: RCC marker, CD10 (redundant)
```

### Melanoma (Confirmation)
```
Panel: S100, SOX10, Melan-A, HMB45
Distance Metric: Hamming or Chi-squared

Expected:
├─ S100 + SOX10 cluster (nuclear, distance ~0.4)
└─ Melan-A + HMB45 separate (cytoplasmic)

Optimization:
✅ Keep: S100 + HMB45 (different patterns)
⚠️ Add SOX10 if S100 equivocal
```

## Statistical Significance

### P-value Interpretation
```
P-value     Confidence    Interpretation
────────────────────────────────────────────
< 0.001     99.9%         Very strong association
< 0.01      99%           Strong association
< 0.05      95%           Moderate association
≥ 0.05      < 95%         No significant association
```

### Cramér's V Effect Size
```
For 2×2 Tables (Binary Markers):

V           Interpretation     Clinical Meaning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0.0 - 0.1   Negligible        Independent markers
0.1 - 0.3   Weak              Slight relationship
0.3 - 0.5   Moderate          Notable co-expression
0.5 - 0.7   Strong            Often co-express
0.7 - 1.0   Very strong       Nearly always together
1.0         Perfect           Always co-express
```

### Jaccard Index (Co-positivity)
```
Jaccard     Interpretation     Action
────────────────────────────────────────────
> 0.8       Very high overlap  Consider dropping one
0.6 - 0.8   High overlap       Evaluate clinical need
0.4 - 0.6   Moderate overlap   Keep both
< 0.4       Low overlap        Independent markers
```

## Warning Signs (Red Flags)

### ⚠️ Don't Drop Markers If:

1. **Established in Guidelines**
   - Example: ER + PR in breast cancer
   - Even if clustered, both have clinical utility

2. **Different Diagnostic Contexts**
   - Example: CK7/CK20 pattern changes by tumor type
   - Low GI: CK7-/CK20+ vs Upper GI: CK7+/CK20+

3. **Prognostic Significance**
   - Example: ER+/PR- = worse prognosis
   - Loss of PR is clinically meaningful

4. **Different Sensitivities**
   - Example: S100 (sensitive) vs HMB45 (specific)
   - Both needed for melanoma confirmation

5. **Small Sample Size**
   - Need n > 50 for reliable clustering
   - n < 30 = results may be unstable

---

## Cost-Benefit Calculator

```
Example: Eliminating 2 redundant markers

Marker cost: $60 per antibody
Cases/year: 500
Markers eliminated: 2

Annual savings = $60 × 2 × 500 = $60,000

BUT check:
✓ Does diagnosis change in any cases?
✓ Is validation data convincing (≥95% concordance)?
✓ Do guidelines allow this modification?
```

---

## When to Consult Biostatistics

- Sample size < 50 cases
- Unexpected clustering patterns
- Proposing major panel changes
- Publishing your findings
- Implementing across institution

---

## Workflow Checklist

```
□ 1. Collect ≥50-100 cases with complete IHC data
□ 2. Choose distance metric (Chi-squared/Euclidean/Mixed)
□ 3. Run clustering analysis in jamovi
□ 4. Review dendrogram for marker groups
□ 5. Check p-values and effect sizes
□ 6. Identify distance < 0.3 (potential redundancy)
□ 7. Review clinical literature for validation
□ 8. Calculate cost savings
□ 9. Pilot optimized panel on 20-30 new cases
□ 10. Require ≥95% concordance before adoption
□ 11. Document protocol and share with colleagues
□ 12. Monitor performance and adjust annually
```

## Example Interpretations

### Good Clustering Result ✅
```
Dendrogram shows:
├─ Clear separation between diagnostic groups
├─ Markers within groups have distance < 0.3
└─ Between groups distance > 0.7

Interpretation: Well-designed panel
Action: Consider eliminating within-group redundancy
```

### Problematic Clustering Result ⚠️
```
Dendrogram shows:
├─ All markers cluster together (distance 0.1-0.2)
└─ No clear groups

Interpretation: Over-redundant panel OR technical issue
Action:
1. Check if markers actually worked (not all negative)
2. Review case selection (diverse enough?)
3. Consider adding markers from different pathways
```

### Unexpected Clustering Result 🔍
```
Dendrogram shows:
├─ TTF1 clusters with p40 (should be opposite!)
└─ Distance 0.15 (very close)

Interpretation: Data quality issue
Action:
1. Check for column swap in data entry
2. Verify case diagnoses
3. Review staining patterns (technical failure?)
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I cluster both patients AND markers?**
A: Yes! Patient clustering (existing) groups cases by IHC profile. Marker clustering (new) groups markers by co-expression. Both provide complementary information.

**Q: Why does my dendrogram look different from colleagues?**
A: Different distance metrics or different case cohorts. Use same metric and validate with independent datasets.

**Q: Markers cluster but literature says they're independent?**
A: Could be: (1) Different tumor types in your cohort, (2) Both often negative (double-negative clustering), (3) Selection bias in your cases. Always validate against literature.

**Q: Can I publish panel optimization based on clustering?**
A: Yes, but need: (1) Sufficient sample size (n>100), (2) Validation cohort, (3) Performance comparison with original panel, (4) Clinical correlation.

**Q: What if clustering contradicts CAP/ASCO guidelines?**
A: Follow guidelines! Clustering is exploratory. Never eliminate required markers based on clustering alone.

## Emergency Troubleshooting

### "All markers show distance ~1.0"
```
Cause: Markers are completely independent OR all different
Check: Is this expected? (e.g., lineage markers)
```

### "All markers show distance ~0.1"
```
Cause: All redundant OR technical failure (all negative)
Check: Staining quality, case diversity
```

### "Dendrogram doesn't make biological sense"
```
Cause: Data entry error, technical issues, unusual cohort
Check: Raw data, swap columns, verify antibodies worked
```

### "Chi-squared test fails"
```
Cause: Small sample size, sparse cells, constant values
Solution: Use Jaccard or increase sample size
```
