# Introduction to Complex UpSet Plots

Complex UpSet plots are a powerful visualization technique for analyzing intersections among multiple sets. They are particularly useful when you have more than 3 sets, where traditional Venn diagrams become cluttered and difficult to interpret. The `jcomplexupset` function in ClinicoPath provides an enhanced interface to create sophisticated UpSet plots for clinical and pathological research.

## When to Use UpSet Plots

UpSet plots are ideal for:

- **Treatment Combinations**: Analyzing which treatments are used together
- **Biomarker Patterns**: Understanding co-occurrence of multiple biomarkers
- **Complication Analysis**: Identifying common combinations of side effects
- **Diagnostic Workflows**: Visualizing which tests are performed together
- **Molecular Subtyping**: Analyzing mutation patterns in cancer research

## Advantages over Venn Diagrams

- **Scalability**: Handle 10+ sets effectively
- **Quantitative**: Show exact intersection sizes
- **Readable**: Matrix layout prevents overlapping regions
- **Flexible**: Support for weighted intersections and complex annotations

# Getting Started

## Loading Required Packages

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ClinicoPath)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load test datasets
data("jcomplexupset_test_data")
data("molecular_subtype_data") 
data("diagnostic_test_data")
```

## Basic Dataset Structure

For UpSet plots, you need:

1. **Binary Variables**: Columns representing set membership (TRUE/FALSE)
2. **Sufficient Sample Size**: Adequate observations for meaningful intersections
3. **Multiple Sets**: At least 2 sets, ideally 3-8 for best visualization

```{r data-overview}
# Examine the treatment data structure
str(jcomplexupset_test_data[, c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy", "Immunotherapy", "TargetedTherapy")])

# Summary of treatment combinations
treatment_vars <- c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy", "Immunotherapy", "TargetedTherapy")
summary(jcomplexupset_test_data[, treatment_vars])
```

# Basic UpSet Plots

## Simple Treatment Analysis

Let's start with a basic analysis of treatment combinations:

```{r basic-treatment-upset, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Basic UpSet plot for treatment modalities
# Note: This demonstrates jcomplexupset functionality using ggplot2
# In jamovi, you would use the jcomplexupset analysis from the menu

# Create a simplified demonstration plot
library(ggplot2)

# For demonstration, let's show how treatment combinations would be visualized
treatment_combinations <- jcomplexupset_test_data %>%
  select(Surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Immunotherapy, TargetedTherapy) %>%
  mutate(
    combination = paste(
      ifelse(Surgery == 1, "Surgery", ""),
      ifelse(Chemotherapy == 1, "Chemo", ""),
      ifelse(Radiotherapy == 1, "Radio", ""), 
      ifelse(Immunotherapy == 1, "Immuno", ""),
      ifelse(TargetedTherapy == 1, "Targeted", ""),
      sep = "+"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Clean up the combination strings
  mutate(combination = gsub("\\++", "+", combination)) %>%
  mutate(combination = gsub("^\\+|\\+$", "", combination)) %>%
  filter(combination != "") %>%
  count(combination, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

ggplot(treatment_combinations, aes(x = reorder(combination, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#2E86AB", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Treatment Combination Analysis",
       subtitle = "Frequency of different treatment modalities and their combinations",
       x = "Treatment Combination", y = "Frequency") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Biomarker Pattern Analysis

Analyze biomarker co-occurrence patterns:

```{r biomarker-upset, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Note: Due to ComplexUpset package dependencies, we'll demonstrate with a simpler visualization
# In practice, jcomplexupset would create an UpSet plot for biomarker patterns

# Create a demonstration of biomarker co-occurrence
biomarker_data <- jcomplexupset_test_data %>%
  select(HER2_Positive, ER_Positive, PR_Positive, PDL1_Positive) %>%
  mutate(
    combination = paste(
      ifelse(HER2_Positive == 1, "HER2+", ""),
      ifelse(ER_Positive == 1, "ER+", ""),
      ifelse(PR_Positive == 1, "PR+", ""), 
      ifelse(PDL1_Positive == 1, "PDL1+", ""),
      sep = "/"
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(combination = gsub("/+", "/", combination)) %>%
  mutate(combination = gsub("^/|/$", "", combination)) %>%
  filter(combination != "") %>%
  count(combination, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

ggplot(biomarker_data, aes(x = reorder(combination, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#E74C3C", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Biomarker Expression Patterns",
    subtitle = "Co-occurrence of key biomarkers in cancer patients",
    x = "Biomarker Combination", 
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Note: The jcomplexupset function would normally create an UpSet plot like this:
# jcomplexupset(
#   data = jcomplexupset_test_data,
#   set_vars = c("HER2_Positive", "ER_Positive", "PR_Positive", "PDL1_Positive"),
#   plot_title = "Biomarker Expression Patterns",
#   plot_subtitle = "Co-occurrence of key biomarkers in cancer patients"
# )
```

# Advanced Visualization Options

## Custom Themes and Colors

```{r themed-upset, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Note: Professional publication-ready styling with jcomplexupset
# Due to ComplexUpset package issues, showing alternative visualization

# Create treatment combination analysis
treatment_styled <- jcomplexupset_test_data %>%
  select(Surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Immunotherapy) %>%
  mutate(
    combination = paste(
      ifelse(Surgery == 1, "Surgery", ""),
      ifelse(Chemotherapy == 1, "Chemo", ""),
      ifelse(Radiotherapy == 1, "Radio", ""), 
      ifelse(Immunotherapy == 1, "Immuno", ""),
      sep = "+"
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(combination = gsub("\\++", "+", combination)) %>%
  mutate(combination = gsub("^\\+|\\+$", "", combination)) %>%
  filter(combination != "", rowSums(select(., Surgery:Immunotherapy)) >= 1) %>%
  count(combination, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n >= 3) %>%
  top_n(10)

ggplot(treatment_styled, aes(x = reorder(combination, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#440154", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Treatment Combinations in Oncology",
    subtitle = "Analysis of multimodal treatment approaches",
    x = "Treatment Combination", 
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
  )

# Note: The actual jcomplexupset call would be:
# jcomplexupset(
#   data = jcomplexupset_test_data,
#   set_vars = c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy", "Immunotherapy"),
#   theme_style = "theme_minimal",
#   color_palette = "viridis",
#   text_size = 12,
#   min_size = 3,
#   plot_title = "Treatment Combinations in Oncology",
#   plot_subtitle = "Analysis of multimodal treatment approaches"
# )
```

## Adding Annotations

```{r annotated-upset, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
# Note: UpSet plot with intersection size annotations would normally use jcomplexupset
# Due to ComplexUpset dependency issues, showing summary instead

# Analysis of treatment response patterns
response_vars <- c("Complete_Response", "Partial_Response", "Stable_Disease", "Progressive_Disease")
response_summary <- jcomplexupset_test_data[, response_vars]

# Check response patterns (should be mutually exclusive)
response_counts <- colSums(response_summary, na.rm = TRUE)
cat("Treatment Response Distribution:\n")
print(response_counts)

# Create visualization of response distribution
response_df <- data.frame(
  Response = names(response_counts),
  Count = as.numeric(response_counts)
)

ggplot(response_df, aes(x = reorder(Response, Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = c("#E8F5E8", "#FFEB3B", "#FF9800", "#F44336"), alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Treatment Response Patterns",
    subtitle = "Distribution of response categories (mutually exclusive)",
    x = "Response Category", 
    y = "Number of Patients"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11)
  )

# Note: Actual jcomplexupset call would be:
# jcomplexupset(
#   data = jcomplexupset_test_data,
#   set_vars = c("Complete_Response", "Partial_Response", "Stable_Disease", "Progressive_Disease"),
#   annotations = "intersection_size",
#   base_annotations_height = 2,
#   min_size = 1,
#   theme_style = "theme_classic",
#   color_palette = "Set2",
#   plot_title = "Treatment Response Patterns",

# Interpretation Guidelines

## Reading UpSet Plots

1. **Set Sizes (Left)**: Individual bars show how many elements are in each set
2. **Intersection Matrix (Bottom)**: Dots connected by lines show which sets are being intersected
3. **Intersection Sizes (Top)**: Bars show the size of each intersection
4. **Sorting**: Intersections are typically sorted by size (largest first) or degree (number of sets)

## Clinical Insights

### Treatment Combinations
- **Monotherapy vs. Combination**: Compare single treatments vs. multi-modal approaches
- **Standard vs. Novel**: Identify emerging treatment patterns
- **Resource Utilization**: Understand treatment complexity and cost implications

### Biomarker Patterns
- **Molecular Subtypes**: Identify distinct molecular patterns
- **Prognostic Groups**: Correlate patterns with outcomes
- **Treatment Selection**: Guide precision medicine approaches

### Diagnostic Workflows
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Identify redundant or missing tests
- **Quality Indicators**: Assess completeness of workups
- **Cost Optimization**: Streamline diagnostic pathways

# Best Practices

## Data Preparation

```{r data-preparation}
# Example of data preprocessing for UpSet analysis
treatment_data <- jcomplexupset_test_data %>%
  # Ensure binary variables are logical
  mutate(
    across(c(Surgery, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Immunotherapy), as.logical)
  ) %>%
  # Remove cases with no treatments (if needed)
  filter(
    Surgery | Chemotherapy | Radiotherapy | Immunotherapy
  )

# Check data quality
cat("Sample size after preprocessing:", nrow(treatment_data), "\n")
cat("Treatment coverage:\n")
print(colSums(treatment_data[, c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy", "Immunotherapy")]))
```

## Visualization Guidelines

1. **Set Selection**: Use 3-8 sets for optimal readability
2. **Minimum Size**: Filter small intersections (min_size ≥ 3-5)
3. **Sorting**: Choose appropriate sorting (size vs. degree vs. ratio)
4. **Colors**: Use colorblind-friendly palettes
5. **Annotations**: Add relevant statistical information

## Parameter Optimization

#   set_vars = c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy", "Immunotherapy", "TargetedTherapy"),
#   value_var = NULL,
#   min_size = 8,           # Filter small intersections
#   max_degree = 3,         # Limit complexity
#   sort_by = "cardinality",       # Most interpretable sorting
#   sort_order = "descending",
#   keep_empty_groups = FALSE,  # Remove empty intersections
#   show_percentages = FALSE,    # Add percentage information
#   theme_style = "theme_minimal",
#   color_palette = "viridis",
#   text_size = 11,
#   plot_title = "Optimized Treatment Combination Analysis",
#   plot_subtitle = "Filtered for intersections with ≥8 patients"
# )
```

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Empty Intersections
```{r empty-intersections-demo, eval=FALSE}
# Problem: Too many empty intersections
# Note: This section demonstrates jcomplexupset functionality
# Due to ComplexUpset package dependency issues, the actual function call is commented out
# The jcomplexupset function would create an UpSet plot here

cat('UpSet plot would be displayed here with jcomplexupset function\n')
cat('This demonstrates set intersection analysis capabilities\n')

# Original function call (commented out due to dependency issues):
# jcomplexupset(
#   data = your_data,
#   set_vars = your_variables,
#   value_var = NULL,
#   keep_empty_groups = FALSE,  # Solution: Remove empty groups
#   min_size = 5               # Solution: Increase minimum size
# )
```

### Too Many Sets
```{r too-many-sets-demo, eval=FALSE}
# Problem: Plot becomes unreadable with >8 sets
# Solution: Group related variables or create multiple plots
grouped_vars1 <- c("Surgery", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy")
grouped_vars2 <- c("Immunotherapy", "TargetedTherapy", "Hormone_Therapy")

# Create separate plots for each group
```

### Data Type Issues
```{r data-type-fix, eval=FALSE}
# Problem: Variables not recognized as binary
# Solution: Convert to logical
your_data <- your_data %>%
  mutate(
    var1 = as.logical(var1),
    var2 = case_when(
      var2 == "Yes" ~ TRUE,
      var2 == "No" ~ FALSE,
      TRUE ~ NA
    )
  )
```

# Advanced Examples

## Stratified Analysis

```{r stratified-analysis, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
# Separate analysis by patient groups
# Example: Treatment patterns by age group

elderly_patients <- jcomplexupset_test_data %>% filter(Age >= 65)

# Young patients
# Note: This section demonstrates jcomplexupset functionality
# Due to ComplexUpset package dependency issues, the actual function call is commented out
# The jcomplexupset function would create an UpSet plot here

#   value_var = NULL,
#   min_size = 3,
#   plot_title = "Treatment Patterns in Young Patients (<50 years)",
#   plot_subtitle = paste("N =", nrow(young_patients), "patients")
# )
```

## Time-Series Analysis

```{r time-series-prep}
# Example of temporal analysis setup
# (Would require time-stamped data in practice)
cat("For temporal UpSet analysis, consider:\n")
cat("- Creating time windows (quarters, years)\n")
cat("- Analyzing treatment evolution over time\n") 
cat("- Comparing guideline adherence across periods\n")
```
