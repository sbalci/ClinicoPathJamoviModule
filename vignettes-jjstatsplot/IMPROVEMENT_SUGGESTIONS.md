# Suggestions for Improving the jjstatsplot Vignettes

This document outlines suggestions for improving the vignettes for the `jjstatsplot` module to make them more accessible and useful for the target audience: statistics-naive clinicians and researchers.

## General Recommendations

1.  **Focus on the Jamovi GUI**: The primary audience uses the Jamovi point-and-click interface. The documentation should reflect this. All vignettes should be framed around the Jamovi GUI, not the underlying R functions.
2.  **Include Visuals**: The vignettes are for a visualization package, so they must be visual. Every vignette should include:
    *   **Screenshots** of the Jamovi interface showing where to click.
    *   The final **output plot** that is generated.
3.  **Provide Interpretation**: Don't just show how to create a plot; explain how to interpret it. Each example should include a section on "Clinical Interpretation" or "How to Read This Plot".
4.  **Use Clinically Relevant Data**: All examples should use the clinical datasets included in the package (e.g., `histopathology`, `breast_cancer_data`). The `mtcars` dataset should not be used.
5.  **Adopt a Consistent Structure**: Every vignette should follow a consistent, user-friendly structure.

## Proposed Vignette Structure

I recommend the following structure for each vignette:

1.  **Title**: A clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Comparing Two Groups with Box-Violin Plots").
2.  **Clinical Scenario**: Start with a simple, relatable clinical research question.
    *   *Example*: "We want to see if there is a difference in the age of patients between two treatment groups."
3.  **Step-by-Step Guide (with Screenshots)**: Provide a numbered list of steps to perform the analysis in Jamovi. Each step should be accompanied by a screenshot.
    *   *Example*:
        1.  "Go to the 'Analyses' tab and click on 'JJStatsPlot'."
        2.  "Select 'Box-Violin Plots (Between Groups)'."
        3.  "Move the 'Age' variable to the 'Dependent Variable' box and the 'Treatment_Group' variable to the 'Grouping Variable' box."
4.  **The Output Plot**: Show the plot that Jamovi generates.
5.  **Interpreting the Plot**: Explain how to read the plot in the context of the clinical scenario.
    *   *Example*: "The plot shows the distribution of age for each treatment group. The thick horizontal line in the middle of each box is the median age. The boxes show the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data). The 'violins' show the overall distribution of the data. We can see that the median age in Group A is slightly higher than in Group B."
6.  **Interpreting the Statistics**: Explain the statistical results in simple terms.
    *   *Example*: "The p-value is 0.03. Since this is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in age between the two groups. The effect size (Cohen's d) is 0.45, which is considered a medium effect."
7.  **Reporting the Results**: Provide a template for how to report the findings in a paper or presentation.
    *   *Example*: "A two-sample t-test was performed to compare the age of patients in the two treatment groups. There was a statistically significant difference in age between the groups (t(98) = 2.2, p = 0.03), with a medium effect size (d = 0.45). The mean age in Group A was 65.2 years (SD = 5.1), and the mean age in Group B was 62.1 years (SD = 4.8)."
8.  **R Code (Optional)**: The R code to reproduce the analysis can be included at the end in a collapsed section for advanced users.

## Specific Recommendations for Existing Files

*   **`01-jamovi-user-guide.Rmd`**: This should be the main introductory vignette. It should be updated to include screenshots and use a clinical example.
*   **`01-introduction.Rmd`**: This file is too code-heavy for an introduction. The useful clinical context and interpretation guidelines should be merged into the other vignettes. The rest of it can be deprecated or moved to an "advanced R user" guide.
*   **`02-categorical-plots.Rmd`, `03-continuous-comparisons.Rmd`, `05-correlations-scatterplots.Rmd`**: These should be rewritten to follow the proposed vignette structure. They should use clinical data and include screenshots and interpretation.
*   **`13-quick-reference.Rmd`**: This could be turned into a "Plot Gallery" or "Cheat Sheet". It should show an image of each type of plot the module can create, with a brief, one-sentence description of when to use it.
*   **Render all `.Rmd` files**: The `eval=FALSE` chunk option should be removed from all vignettes so that the plots are rendered in the final HTML files.

By following these recommendations, the `jjstatsplot` documentation can become a much more valuable resource for clinicians and researchers, empowering them to perform their own data analysis and visualization with confidence.
