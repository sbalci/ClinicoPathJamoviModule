The ClinicoPathJamoviModule is a comprehensive open-source toolkit for streamlining clinicopathological research. It provides an integrated suite of statistical tools, visualization methods, and reporting functions tailored for pathology, clinical research, and medical decision-making.

## Features

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Generation of publication-ready summary tables (`Table 1`).
- **Survival Analysis:** Tools for Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models.
- **Diagnostic Accuracy:** Evaluation of diagnostic tests using ROC curve analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), and screening test calculators.
- **Agreement and Reliability:** Assessment of inter-rater reliability using statistics such as Cohenâ€™s Kappa and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).
